Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and\nautomated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs\nare not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative\non-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on\ntwo-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal\ncar-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral\nlane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for\nhuman-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human\nfactors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a\nHCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based\non the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model\nbased on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the\nelitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and\nefficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under\ndifferent traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The\nfindings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in\nenhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging\nprocess, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption\ncompared with benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u531d\u9053\u5408\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff08HCOMC\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CAV\u548cHDV\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u71c3\u6cb9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u531d\u9053\u5408\u5e76\u533a\u57df\u56e0\u4ea4\u901a\u62e5\u5835\u548c\u4e8b\u6545\u9891\u53d1\u800c\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728CAV\u5c1a\u672a\u666e\u53ca\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u865a\u62df\u8f66\u8f86\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53d8\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5c42\u5408\u4f5c\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cHCOMC\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea4\u901a\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548cCAV\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u71c3\u6cb9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HCOMC\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u531d\u9053\u5408\u5e76\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While autonomous driving (AD) systems have\nmatured significantly, AR presents unique challenges due to the inherent\ninstability of two-wheeled platforms, limited size, limited power, and\nunpredictable environments, which pose very serious concerns about road users'\nsafety. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of AR systems by\nsystematically examining their core components, perception, planning, and\ncontrol, through the lens of AD technologies. We identify critical gaps in\ncurrent AR research, including a lack of comprehensive perception systems for\nvarious AR tasks, limited industry and government support for such\ndevelopments, and insufficient attention from the research community. The\nreview analyses the gaps of AR from the perspective of AD to highlight\npromising research directions, such as multimodal sensor techniques for\nlightweight platforms and edge deep learning architectures.

To address this, we\nintroduce Hybrid Prediction-based Risk-Aware Planning (HyPRAP), a\nprediction-based risk-aware path-planning framework which uses a hybrid\ncombination of models to predict local obstacle movement. HyPRAP uses a novel\nPrediction-based Collision Risk Index (P-CRI) to evaluate the risk posed by\neach obstacle, enabling the selective use of predictors based on whether the\nagent prioritizes high predictive accuracy or low computational prediction\noverhead. This selective routing enables the agent to focus on high-risk\nobstacles while ignoring or simplifying low-risk ones, making it suitable for\nenvironments with a large number of obstacles.

Recent advances in\nlarge-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.\nHowever, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in\nperformance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental\nchanges. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,\nwe abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:\nsimilarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the\ngrasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly\nachieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key\nsteps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform\nsimilarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,\nidentifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate\nmodels with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the\nunknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local\nfine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy\nobservation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that\nintegrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive\nevaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,\nthe C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between\npartial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database\nmodels. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce\nthe semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration\napproach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under\nsingle-view conditions.

This\nregrettable omission is in spite of the fact that many functions in modern day\napplications of optimization can be shown to be quasi-differentiable.

This study addresses the\nrobust route planning problem for sidewalk robots, explicitly accounting for\ntravel time uncertainty due to varying sidewalk conditions. Optimization is\nintegrated with simulation to reproduce the effect of obstacles and pedestrian\nflows and generate realistic travel times. The study investigates three\ndifferent approaches to derive uncertainty sets, including budgeted,\nellipsoidal, and support vector clustering (SVC)-based methods, along with a\ndistributionally robust method to solve the shortest path (SP) problem. A\nrealistic case study reproducing pedestrian patterns in Stockholm's city center\nis used to evaluate the efficiency of robust routing across various robot\ndesigns and environmental conditions. The results show that, when compared to a\nconventional SP, robust routing significantly enhances operational reliability\nunder variable sidewalk conditions. The Ellipsoidal and DRSP approaches\noutperform the other methods, yielding the most efficient paths in terms of\naverage and worst-case delay.

Out-of-domain\nuncertainty arises when the system operates under conditions not represented in\nthe initial training dataset, while in-domain uncertainty results from\nreal-world variability and flaws in the model structure or training process. To\nhandle out-of-domain uncertainty, a slow learning component, inspired by the\nhuman brain's slow thinking process, learns system dynamics under unexplored\noperating conditions, and it is activated only when a monitoring strategy deems\nit necessary. This component consists of an ensemble of models, featuring (i) a\ncombination rule that weights individual models based on the statistical\nproximity between their training data and the current operating condition, and\n(ii) a monitoring algorithm based on statistical control charts that supervises\nthe ensemble's reliability and triggers the offline training and integration of\na new model when a new operating condition is detected.

Flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS)\ndevices are essential to ensure reliable grid operations and enable the\nefficient integration of renewable energy. This work introduces a mixed-integer\nsecond-order cone programming (MISOCP) model for the multi-period scheduling of\nkey FACTS devices in electric transmission systems. The proposed model\nintegrates four key control mechanisms: (i) on-load tap changers (OLTCs) for\nvoltage regulation via discrete taps; (ii) static synchronous compensators\n(STATCOMs) and (iii) shunt reactors for reactive power compensation; and (iv)\nthyristor-controlled series capacitors (TCSCs) for adjustable impedance and\nflow control. The objective is to minimize active power losses using a limited\nnumber of control actions while meeting physical and operational constraints at\nall times throughout the defined time horizon. To ensure tractability, the\nmodel employs a second-order cone relaxation of the power flow.

It has emerged as a prominent\napproach, particularly in leveraging bit-level sparsity in Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs). However, existing bit-serial accelerators exploit bit-level sparsity to\nreduce computations by skipping zero bits, but they suffer from inefficient\nmemory accesses due to the irregular indices of the non-zero bits.\n  As memory accesses typically are the dominant contributor to DNN accelerator\nperformance, this paper introduces a novel computing approach called\n\"bit-column-serial\" and a compatible architecture design named \"BitWave.\"\nBitWave harnesses the advantages of the \"bit-column-serial\" approach,\nleveraging structured bit-level sparsity in combination with dynamic dataflow\ntechniques. This achieves a reduction in computations and memory footprints\nthrough redundant computation skipping and weight compression.

In this work, a uniform LGL\nmethod is proposed, termed UniLGL, which simultaneously achieves spatial and\nmaterial uniformity, as well as sensor-type uniformity. The key idea of the\nproposed method is to encode the complete point cloud, which contains both\ngeometric and material information, into a pair of BEV images (i.e., a spatial\nBEV image and an intensity BEV image). An end-to-end multi-BEV fusion network\nis designed to extract uniform features, equipping UniLGL with spatial and\nmaterial uniformity. To ensure robust LGL across heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, a\nviewpoint invariance hypothesis is introduced, which replaces the conventional\ntranslation equivariance assumption commonly used in existing LPR networks and\nsupervises UniLGL to achieve sensor-type uniformity in both global descriptors\nand local feature representations. Finally, based on the mapping between local\nfeatures on the 2D BEV image and the point cloud, a robust global pose\nestimator is derived that determines the global minimum of the global pose on\nSE(3) without requiring additional registration. To validate the effectiveness\nof the proposed uniform LGL, extensive benchmarks are conducted in real-world\nenvironments, and the results show that the proposed UniLGL is demonstratively\ncompetitive compared to other State-of-the-Art LGL methods. Furthermore, UniLGL\nhas been deployed on diverse platforms, including full-size trucks and agile\nMicro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), to enable high-precision localization and mapping\nas well as multi-MAV collaborative exploration in port and forest environments,\ndemonstrating the applicability of UniLGL in industrial and field scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UniLGL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684LiDAR\u51e0\u4f55\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08LGL\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u6750\u6599\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5747\u5300\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u591aBEV\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u89c6\u70b9\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LGL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u90e8\u5206LiDAR\u6570\u636e\u6216\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5747\u5300\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6BEV\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591aBEV\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u89c6\u70b9\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eUniLGL\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "conclusion": "UniLGL\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u548c\u91ce\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Recent studies suggest that\nhuman-like driving behavior emerges from embedding risk in AV motion planning\nalgorithms. Additionally, providing evidence that risk is minimized during the\nAV operation is essential to vehicle safety certification. However, there has\nyet to be a consensus on how to define and operationalize risk in motion\nplanning or how to bound or minimize it during operation. In this paper, we\ndefine a stochastic risk measure and introduce it as a constraint into both\nrobust and stochastic nonlinear model predictive path-following controllers\n(RMPC and SMPC respectively). We compare the vehicle's behavior arising from\nemploying SMPC and RMPC with respect to safety and path-following performance.\nFurther, the implementation of an automated driving example is provided,\nshowcasing the effects of different risk tolerances and uncertainty growths in\npredictions of other road users for both cases. We find that the RMPC is\nsignificantly more conservative than the SMPC, while also displaying greater\nfollowing errors towards references. Further, the RMPCs behavior cannot be\nconsidered as human-like. Moreover, unlike SMPC, the RMPC cannot account for\ndifferent risk tolerances.
