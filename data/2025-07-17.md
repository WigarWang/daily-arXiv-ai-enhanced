### [1] [A Deep Reinforcement Learning Method for Multi-objective Transmission Switching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11726)
*Ding Lin,Jianhui Wang,Tianqiao Zhao,Meng Yue*

Main category: eess.SY

Motivation: 传统的输电切换方法以成本最小化为目标，可能牺牲系统可靠性。多目标优化虽能平衡两者，但随着系统规模扩大，计算复杂度激增，难以实现可行解。

Method: 采用双优势演员-评论家框架的DRL方法，评估线路切换决策的相对影响，提升决策质量，兼顾可靠性与成本效率。

Result: 在IEEE 118总线系统中的数值研究表明，该方法在效率与效果上优于两种基准DRL算法。

Conclusion: 提出的DRL方法能有效解决多目标输电切换问题，兼具计算效率与决策优化潜力。

Abstract: Transmission switching is a well-established approach primarily applied to
minimize operational costs through strategic network reconfiguration. However,
exclusive focus on cost reduction can compromise system reliability. While
multi-objective transmission switching can balance cost savings with
reliability improvements, feasible solutions become exceedingly difficult to
obtain as system scale grows, due to the inherent nonlinearity and high
computational demands involved. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) method for multi-objective transmission switching. The method
incorporates a dueling-based actor-critic framework to evaluate the relative
impact of each line switching decision within the action space, which improves
decision quality and enhances both system reliability and cost efficiency.
Numerical studies on the IEEE 118-bus system verify the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed approach compared to two benchmark DRL algorithms.

Abstract: The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is rapidly growing as a key solution
to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, prolonged charging times remain
a significant barrier to widespread EV usage, especially for individuals
without access to fast charging infrastructure. This paper explores the
potential of reconfigurable battery systems to reduce EV charging times without
compromising battery life. We propose innovative battery pack configurations
that dynamically adjust the arrangement of cells to optimize charging
performance. Simulations were conducted using MATLAB and Simulink to compare
the efficiency of various battery configurations, focusing on charging times,
state of charge (SOC), voltage, and current under different conditions. The
results demonstrate that connecting more batteries in series through
reconfigurability in battery packs can significantly reduce charging times
while maintaining operational safety. This study offers insights into how
reconfigurable battery designs can provide a practical solution for faster,
more efficient home-based EV charging, making EV ownership more accessible and
sustainable.

Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of GaN high-electron-mobility transistors
(HEMTs) using both TCAD simulation and experimental characterization. The
energy band structure was studied using Nextnano simulation software to observe
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) formation and carrier confinement under
equilibrium conditions. Additionally, I-V and C-V data from fabricated
research-grade GaN HEMTs were analyzed to extract key electrical parameters.
The device demonstrated an ON current of 1.9 mA and an OFF current of 0.01 mA,
indicating a strong ON/OFF current ratio. A subthreshold swing of 80 mV/decade
and a DIBL of 5 mV/V were observed, confirming good gate control and
short-channel suppression. The ON-resistance was 22.72 ohm per micron, with a
saturation voltage of 1 V . The peak transconductance was extracted as 0.18 mS
in the linear region and 0.5 mS in saturation. Field-effect mobility was
calculated using the transconductance method, with a maximum value of
approximately 1200 cm2/V.s at low drain bias. The combined simulation and

### [4] [Algorithm Design and Comparative Test of Natural Gradient Gaussian Approximation Filter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11872)
*Wenhan Cao,Tianyi Zhang,Shengbo Eben Li*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: NANO滤波器是一种新型贝叶斯滤波算法，通过自然梯度下降和优化问题解决非线性非高斯系统中的滤波问题，性能优于传统卡尔曼滤波器家族。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯滤波依赖线性化技术（如泰勒展开和随机线性回归），在非线性非高斯系统中可能引入较大估计误差，因此需要更优的滤波算法。

Method: NANO滤波器将贝叶斯滤波解释为两个优化问题，利用自然梯度下降直接最小化更新目标，避免线性化误差；设计遵循预测和更新两步结构。

Result: 在四种经典系统（线性振荡器、序列预测、生长模型、机器人定位）及多种噪声条件下，NANO滤波性能优于EKF、UKF、IEKF和PLF，且计算负担相似。

Conclusion: NANO滤波器在非线性非高斯系统中表现出色，具有鲁棒性和高效性，优于传统卡尔曼滤波器家族。

Abstract: Popular Bayes filters typically rely on linearization techniques such as
Taylor series expansion and stochastic linear regression to use the structure
of standard Kalman filter. These techniques may introduce large estimation
errors in nonlinear and non-Gaussian systems. This paper overviews a recent
breakthrough in filtering algorithm design called \textit{N}atural
Gr\textit{a}dient Gaussia\textit{n} Appr\textit{o}ximation (NANO) filter and
compare its performance over a large class of nonlinear filters. The NANO
filter interprets Bayesian filtering as solutions to two distinct optimization
problems, which allows to define optimal Gaussian approximation and derive its
corresponding extremum conditions. The algorithm design still follows the
two-step structure of Bayes filters. In the prediction step, NANO filter
calculates the first two moments of the prior distribution, and this process is
equivalent to a moment-matching filter. In the update step, natural gradient
descent is employed to directly minimize the objective of the update step,
thereby avoiding errors caused by model linearization. Comparative tests are
conducted on four classic systems, including the damped linear oscillator,
sequence forecasting, modified growth model, and robot localization, under
Gaussian, Laplace, and Beta noise to evaluate the NANO filter's capability in
handling nonlinearity. Additionally, we validate the NANO filter's robustness
to data outliers using a satellite attitude estimation example. It is observed
that the NANO filter outperforms popular Kalman filters family such as extended
Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), iterated extended Kalman
filter (IEKF) and posterior linearization filter (PLF), while having similar
computational burden.

### [5] [Advantages of Feedback in Distributed Data-Gathering for Accurate and Power-Efficient State-Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11924)
*Hyeongmin Choe,Soojean Han*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种反馈式分布式数据收集方法（FB），通过中央单元向移动传感器反馈信息以减少冗余传输和通信拥塞，理论分析和数值模拟验证了其性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式目标跟踪传感器网络中，高效的数据收集方法对节省通信资源和保证信息准确性至关重要。

Method: 提出了FB方法，通过中央单元反馈信息给移动传感器，减少冗余传输，并与传统NF架构比较性能。

Result: 理论分析表明，FB的可行性取决于通信功率成本，其优势则取决于传感器的传播延迟。数值模拟验证了理论的准确性。

Conclusion: FB方法在特定条件下表现出优于NF的性能，证明了反馈机制在分布式数据收集中的有效性。

Abstract: In distributed target-tracking sensor networks, efficient data gathering
methods are necessary to save communication resources and assure information
accuracy. This paper proposes a Feedback (FB) distributed data-gathering method
which lets the central unit feed information back to the mobile sensors; each
sensor then uses it to cancel redundant transmissions and reduce communication
congestion. We rigorously compare its performance, in terms of mean-squared
error (MSE) and cost of power per sensor, against more conventional
Non-Feedback (NF) architectures by evaluating conditions of feasibility and
advantage under different architecture specifications (e.g., communication
delay rate, power cost rate, maximum back-off time, sampling period,
observation noise). Here, we defined the advantage as the performance gain
achieved by FB over NF, while FB is said to be feasible if the advantage region
is nonempty. Our theoretical analyses show that the feasibility of FB depends
more on the communication power cost, while the advantage depends on the
sensors' propagation delay per transmission interval; we derive concrete
conditions under which these outcomes hold. Using extensive numerical
simulations under a variety of settings, we confirm the accuracy of the derived
conditions, and show that our theoretical results hold even for more complex
scenarios where the simplifying assumptions no longer hold.

### [6] [Towards Ultra-Reliable 6G in-X Subnetworks: Dynamic Link Adaptation by Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12031)
*Fateme Salehi,Aamir Mahmood,Sarder Fakhrul Abedin,Kyi Thar,Mikael Gidlund*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 6G网络中，提出了一种基于深度强化学习的链路自适应框架，以应对高可靠性和低延迟通信的需求，尤其关注连续数据包中断问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究6G网络中URLLC的极端可靠性需求，特别是连续数据包中断对工业控制和自动化安全的影响。

Method: 使用基于SAC的深度强化学习算法，通过动态调节发射功率和块长度，优化能源效率和可靠性。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法显著优于基线算法，降低了连续中断，同时仅消耗18%的资源成本。

Conclusion: 该框架灵活平衡能源效率和可靠性，适应多样化的工业需求。

Abstract: 6G networks are composed of subnetworks expected to meet ultra-reliable
low-latency communication (URLLC) requirements for mission-critical
applications such as industrial control and automation. An often-ignored aspect
in URLLC is consecutive packet outages, which can destabilize control loops and
compromise safety in in-factory environments. Hence, the current work proposes
a link adaptation framework to support extreme reliability requirements using
the soft actor-critic (SAC)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm
that jointly optimizes energy efficiency (EE) and reliability under dynamic
channel and interference conditions. Unlike prior work focusing on average
reliability, our method explicitly targets reducing burst/consecutive outages
through adaptive control of transmit power and blocklength based solely on the
observed signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The joint optimization
problem is formulated under finite blocklength and quality of service
constraints, balancing reliability and EE. Simulation results show that the
proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms, reducing
outage bursts while consuming only 18\% of the transmission cost required by a
full/maximum resource allocation policy in the evaluated scenario. The
framework also supports flexible trade-off tuning between EE and reliability by
adjusting reward weights, making it adaptable to diverse industrial
requirements.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of distributed resilient state estimation
and control for linear time-invariant systems in the presence of malicious
false data injection sensor attacks and bounded noise. We consider a system
operator (defender) capable of deploying cybersecurity measures to counteract
the sensor compromises. Although such measures enhance resilience against
adversarial attacks, they may incur substantial costs; hence, it is crucial to
select countermeasures to balance resilience gains and cost efficiency
strategically. We first demonstrate that the system's resilience against
attacks is maximized through the appropriate implementation of security
measures, implying that no attacker can execute undetectable sensor attacks.
Building on this analysis, we propose an algorithm that identifies the optimal
security measure. While determining this measure is NP-hard in general, we also
derive sufficient conditions under which efficient computation is feasible.
Furthermore, we develop a distributed resilient state estimation and control
scheme informed by the optimal security measure and establish conditions that
guarantee bounded estimation and control errors. Finally, we validate the
efficacy of our approach via numerical simulations of a vehicle platooning
scenario.

Abstract: Energy Harvesting technologies will play a fundamental role in the
development of the next generation of electronic systems as well as in
advancing the development of sustainable infrastructure. One of the critical
challenges in EH is utilizing ambient vibrations to harvest energy. Piezo
Energy Harvesting, which uses ambient vibrations, is a promising technology in
energy harvesting and a self-powered technology. However, it suffers from
several practical challenges. Some of these challenges include narrow
bandwidth, non-linearity, and impedance mismatch, among others. This paper
presents a novel, simulated Piezo Energy Harvesting (PEH) framework that
addresses some of these challenges. The proposed model is designed to be
adaptive and effective against the inherent non-linearity of PEH. This detailed
model covers a non-linear piezo, Synchronous Electric Charge Extraction (SECE),
Hybrid Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) and a Switched Capacitor Array
(SCA). The SECE extracts the maximum charge accumulated on the piezo every time
the piezo reaches the mechanical extremum. The Bouc-Wen model has been used to
establish nonlinearity in the system. The hybrid MPPT exhibits significant
improvement over conventional P&O, while the SCA-tuned system demonstrates
resilience against variable frequency input.

Abstract: This article addresses the challenge of adapting data-based models over time.
We propose a novel two-fold modelling architecture designed to correct
plant-model mismatch caused by two types of uncertainty. Out-of-domain
uncertainty arises when the system operates under conditions not represented in
the initial training dataset, while in-domain uncertainty results from
real-world variability and flaws in the model structure or training process. To
handle out-of-domain uncertainty, a slow learning component, inspired by the
human brain's slow thinking process, learns system dynamics under unexplored
operating conditions, and it is activated only when a monitoring strategy deems
it necessary. This component consists of an ensemble of models, featuring (i) a
combination rule that weights individual models based on the statistical
proximity between their training data and the current operating condition, and
(ii) a monitoring algorithm based on statistical control charts that supervises
the ensemble's reliability and triggers the offline training and integration of
a new model when a new operating condition is detected. To address in-domain
uncertainty, a fast learning component, inspired by the human brain's fast
thinking process, continuously compensates in real time for the mismatch of the
slow learning model. This component is implemented as a Gaussian process (GP)
model, trained online at each iteration using recent data while discarding
older samples. The proposed methodology is tested on a benchmark energy system
referenced in the literature, demonstrating that the combined use of slow and
fast learning components improves model accuracy compared to standard
adaptation approaches.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督学习框架（NCR），用于解决带输入约束的非线性最优控制问题，通过神经网络预测最优状态轨迹并结合二次规划求解器，其性能优于非线性MPC，且计算时间更短。

Result: NCR在收敛误差和输入轨迹平滑度上优于非线性MPC，计算时间快两个数量级，且适用于训练域外的系统条件。

Conclusion: NCR框架在性能和效率上均优于传统非线性MPC，适用于实时控制问题。

Abstract: We propose a novel unsupervised learning framework for solving nonlinear
optimal control problems (OCPs) with input constraints in real-time. In this
framework, a neural network (NN) learns to predict the optimal co-state
trajectory that minimizes the control Hamiltonian for a given system, at any
system's state, based on the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP).
Specifically, the NN is trained to find the norm-optimal co-state solution that
simultaneously satisfies the nonlinear system dynamics and minimizes a
quadratic regulation cost. The control input is then extracted from the
predicted optimal co-state trajectory by solving a quadratic program (QP) to
satisfy input constraints and optimality conditions. We coin the term neural
co-state regulator (NCR) to describe the combination of the co-state NN and
control input QP solver. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the NCR, we
compare its feedback control performance with that of an expert nonlinear model
predictive control (MPC) solver on a unicycle model. Because the NCR's training
does not rely on expert nonlinear control solvers which are often suboptimal,
the NCR is able to produce solutions that outperform the nonlinear MPC solver
in terms of convergence error and input trajectory smoothness even for system
conditions that are outside its original training domain. At the same time, the
NCR offers two orders of magnitude less computational time than the nonlinear
MPC.

Conclusion: 所提出的MISOCP模型为FACTS设备的调度提供了有效工具，适用于解决现代电力系统中的运行优化问题。

Abstract: With the increasing energy demand and the growing integration of renewable
sources of energy, power systems face operational challenges such as overloads,
losses, and stability concerns, particularly as networks operate near their
capacity limits. Flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS)
devices are essential to ensure reliable grid operations and enable the
efficient integration of renewable energy. This work introduces a mixed-integer
second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model for the multi-period scheduling of
key FACTS devices in electric transmission systems. The proposed model
integrates four key control mechanisms: (i) on-load tap changers (OLTCs) for
voltage regulation via discrete taps; (ii) static synchronous compensators
(STATCOMs) and (iii) shunt reactors for reactive power compensation; and (iv)
thyristor-controlled series capacitors (TCSCs) for adjustable impedance and
flow control. The objective is to minimize active power losses using a limited
number of control actions while meeting physical and operational constraints at
all times throughout the defined time horizon. To ensure tractability, the
model employs a second-order cone relaxation of the power flow. Device-specific
constraints are handled via binary expansion and linearization: OLTCs and shunt
reactors are modelled with discrete variables, STATCOMs through reactive power
bounds, and TCSCs using a reformulation-linearization technique (RLT). A
multi-period formulation captures the sequential nature of decision making,
ensuring consistency across time steps. The model is evaluated on the IEEE
9-bus, 30-bus, and RTS96 test systems, demonstrating its ability to reduce
losses, with potential applicability to larger-scale grids.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring robustness in the presence of
system perturbations for symbolic control techniques. Given a discrete-time
control system that is related to its symbolic model by an alternating
simulation relation. In this paper, we focus on computing the maximum
robustness margin under which the symbolic model remains valid for a
perturbed-version of the discrete-time control system. We first show that
symbolic models are inherently equipped with a certain free robustness margins.
We then provide constructive procedures to compute uniform and non-uniform
(state and input dependent) robustness margins. We also show that the tightness
of the robustness margin depends on the tightness of the reachability technique
used to compute the symbolic model. We then explain how the computed robustness
margin can be used for the sake of controller synthesis. Finally, we present
two illustrative examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: BitWave通过后训练优化和权重位翻转技术，实现了性能提升同时避免重新训练需求，是DNN加速器的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Bit-serial computation facilitates bit-wise sequential data processing,
offering numerous benefits, such as a reduced area footprint and
dynamically-adaptive computational precision. It has emerged as a prominent
approach, particularly in leveraging bit-level sparsity in Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs). However, existing bit-serial accelerators exploit bit-level sparsity to
reduce computations by skipping zero bits, but they suffer from inefficient
memory accesses due to the irregular indices of the non-zero bits.
  As memory accesses typically are the dominant contributor to DNN accelerator
performance, this paper introduces a novel computing approach called
"bit-column-serial" and a compatible architecture design named "BitWave."
BitWave harnesses the advantages of the "bit-column-serial" approach,
leveraging structured bit-level sparsity in combination with dynamic dataflow
techniques. This achieves a reduction in computations and memory footprints
through redundant computation skipping and weight compression. BitWave is able
to mitigate the performance drop or the need for retraining that is typically
associated with sparsity-enhancing techniques using a post-training
optimization involving selected weight bit-flips. Empirical studies conducted
on four deep-learning benchmarks demonstrate the achievements of BitWave: (1)
Maximally realize 13.25x higher speedup, 7.71x efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art sparsity-aware accelerators. (2) Occupying 1.138 mm2 area and
consuming 17.56 mW power in 16nm FinFet process node.

Conclusion: HCOMC在混合交通流中展现出明显优势，为匝道合并问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Highway on-ramp merging areas are common bottlenecks to traffic congestion
and accidents. Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and
automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs
are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative
on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on
two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal
car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral
lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for
human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human
factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a
HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based
on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model
based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the
elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and
efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under
different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The
findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in
enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging
process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption
compared with benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有电动轮椅缺乏灵活性且难以在受限空间中导航，而完全自主或手动控制的轮椅可能影响效率和用户信任，因此需要一种更高效的导航解决方案。

Method: 基于ROS系统的CoNav Chair采用共享控制导航和避障功能，设计三种导航模式（手动、共享和完全自主），并通过21名健康参与者进行室内评估。

Abstract: As the global population of people with disabilities (PWD) continues to grow,
so will the need for mobility solutions that promote independent living and
social integration. Wheelchairs are vital for the mobility of PWD in both
indoor and outdoor environments. The current SOTA in powered wheelchairs is
based on either manually controlled or fully autonomous modes of operation,
offering limited flexibility and often proving difficult to navigate in
spatially constrained environments. Moreover, research on robotic wheelchairs
has focused predominantly on complete autonomy or improved manual control;
approaches that can compromise efficiency and user trust. To overcome these
challenges, this paper introduces the CoNav Chair, a smart wheelchair based on
the Robot Operating System (ROS) and featuring shared control navigation and
obstacle avoidance capabilities that are intended to enhance navigational
efficiency, safety, and ease of use for the user. The paper outlines the CoNav
Chair's design and presents a preliminary usability evaluation comparing three
distinct navigation modes, namely, manual, shared, and fully autonomous,
conducted with 21 healthy, unimpaired participants traversing an indoor
building environment. Study findings indicated that the shared control
navigation framework had significantly fewer collisions and performed
comparably, if not superior to the autonomous and manual modes, on task
completion time, trajectory length, and smoothness; and was perceived as being
safer and more efficient based on user reported subjective assessments of
usability. Overall, the CoNav system demonstrated acceptable safety and
performance, laying the foundation for subsequent usability testing with end
users, namely, PWDs who rely on a powered wheelchair for mobility.

Abstract: In robotics, the effective integration of environmental data into actionable
knowledge remains a significant challenge due to the variety and
incompatibility of data formats commonly used in scene descriptions, such as
MJCF, URDF, and SDF. This paper presents a novel approach that addresses these
challenges by developing a unified scene graph model that standardizes these
varied formats into the Universal Scene Description (USD) format. This
standardization facilitates the integration of these scene graphs with robot
ontologies through semantic reporting, enabling the translation of complex
environmental data into actionable knowledge essential for cognitive robotic
control. We evaluated our approach by converting procedural 3D environments
into USD format, which is then annotated semantically and translated into a
knowledge graph to effectively answer competency questions, demonstrating its
utility for real-time robotic decision-making. Additionally, we developed a
web-based visualization tool to support the semantic mapping process, providing
users with an intuitive interface to manage the 3D environment.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of micromobility solutions, particularly two-wheeled
vehicles like e-scooters and e-bikes, has created an urgent need for reliable
autonomous riding (AR) technologies. While autonomous driving (AD) systems have
matured significantly, AR presents unique challenges due to the inherent
instability of two-wheeled platforms, limited size, limited power, and
unpredictable environments, which pose very serious concerns about road users'
safety. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of AR systems by
systematically examining their core components, perception, planning, and
control, through the lens of AD technologies. We identify critical gaps in
current AR research, including a lack of comprehensive perception systems for
various AR tasks, limited industry and government support for such
developments, and insufficient attention from the research community. The
review analyses the gaps of AR from the perspective of AD to highlight
promising research directions, such as multimodal sensor techniques for
lightweight platforms and edge deep learning architectures. By synthesising
insights from AD research with the specific requirements of AR, this review
aims to accelerate the development of safe, efficient, and scalable autonomous
riding systems for future urban mobility.

Conclusion: CDT-TCS及其衍生算法为系绳机器人路径规划提供了理论和实践支持，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Tethered robots play a pivotal role in specialized environments such as
disaster response and underground exploration, where their stable power supply
and reliable communication offer unparalleled advantages. However, their motion
planning is severely constrained by tether length limitations and entanglement
risks, posing significant challenges to achieving optimal path planning. To
address these challenges, this study introduces CDT-TCS (Convex Dissection
Topology-based Tethered Configuration Search), a novel algorithm that leverages
CDT Encoding as a homotopy invariant to represent topological states of paths.
By integrating algebraic topology with geometric optimization, CDT-TCS
efficiently computes the complete set of optimal feasible configurations for
tethered robots at all positions in 2D environments through a single
computation. Building on this foundation, we further propose three
application-specific algorithms: i) CDT-TPP for optimal tethered path planning,
ii) CDT-TMV for multi-goal visiting with tether constraints, iii) CDT-UTPP for
distance-optimal path planning of untethered robots. All theoretical results
and propositions underlying these algorithms are rigorously proven and
thoroughly discussed in this paper. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in their
respective problem domains. Furthermore, real-world experiments on robotic
platforms validate the practicality and engineering value of the proposed
framework.

Conclusion: NemeSys为实现动态水下环境中的目标驱动自适应自主性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Adaptive mission control and dynamic parameter reconfiguration are essential
for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating in GPS-denied,
communication-limited marine environments. However, most current AUV platforms
execute static, pre-programmed missions or rely on tethered connections and
high-latency acoustic channels for mid-mission updates, significantly limiting
their adaptability and responsiveness. In this paper, we introduce NemeSys, a
novel AUV system designed to support real-time mission reconfiguration through
compact optical and magnetoelectric (OME) signaling facilitated by floating
buoys. We present the full system design, control architecture, and a semantic
mission encoding framework that enables interactive exploration and task
adaptation via low-bandwidth communication. The proposed system is validated
through analytical modeling, controlled experimental evaluations, and
open-water trials. Results confirm the feasibility of online mission adaptation
and semantic task updates, highlighting NemeSys as an online AUV platform for
goal-driven adaptive autonomy in dynamic and uncertain underwater environments.

Result: 理论分析和模拟显示HyPRAP优于单一预测方法，P-CRI比基于邻近度的风险评估更有效。

Conclusion: HyPRAP通过模型多样性和选择性处理，平衡了安全性和计算效率。

Abstract: Real-time path planning in dense, uncertain environments remains a
challenging problem, as predicting the future motions of numerous dynamic
obstacles is computationally burdensome and unrealistic. To address this, we
introduce Hybrid Prediction-based Risk-Aware Planning (HyPRAP), a
prediction-based risk-aware path-planning framework which uses a hybrid
combination of models to predict local obstacle movement. HyPRAP uses a novel
Prediction-based Collision Risk Index (P-CRI) to evaluate the risk posed by
each obstacle, enabling the selective use of predictors based on whether the
agent prioritizes high predictive accuracy or low computational prediction
overhead. This selective routing enables the agent to focus on high-risk
obstacles while ignoring or simplifying low-risk ones, making it suitable for
environments with a large number of obstacles. Moreover, HyPRAP incorporates
uncertainty quantification through hybrid conformal prediction by deriving
confidence bounds simultaneously achieved by multiple predictions across
different models. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that HyPRAP effectively
balances safety and computational efficiency by leveraging the diversity of
prediction models. Extensive simulations validate these insights for more
general settings, confirming that HyPRAP performs better compared to single
predictor methods, and P-CRI performs better over naive proximity-based risk
assessment.

Conclusion: 新方法摆脱了传统学习框架的限制，通过相似性匹配显著提升了抓取的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Grasping unknown objects from a single view has remained a challenging topic
in robotics due to the uncertainty of partial observation. Recent advances in
large-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.
However, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in
performance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental
changes. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,
we abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:
similarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the
grasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly
achieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key
steps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform
similarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,
identifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate
models with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the
unknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local
fine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy
observation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that
integrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive
evaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,
the C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between
partial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database
models. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce
the semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration
approach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under
single-view conditions. Videos are available at https://youtu.be/qQDIELMhQmk.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆在密集交通中由于无法准确预测周围车辆的交互行为，常表现出过于保守或无法满足规划目标的行为。

Method: 结合交互感知神经网络与MPPI控制，预测周围车辆对自动驾驶车辆动作的反应，并在结构化车道环境中引入基于样条的MPPI采样先验分布。

Result: 在密集交通并线场景中验证了IANN-MPPI的高效性能，能够成功完成并线动作。

Conclusion: IANN-MPPI通过交互感知和样条先验分布有效提升了自动驾驶车辆在密集交通中的规划能力。

Abstract: Motion planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in dense traffic is
challenging, often leading to overly conservative behavior and unmet planning
objectives. This challenge stems from the AVs' limited ability to anticipate
and respond to the interactive behavior of surrounding agents. Traditional
decoupled prediction and planning pipelines rely on non-interactive predictions
that overlook the fact that agents often adapt their behavior in response to
the AV's actions. To address this, we propose Interaction-Aware Neural
Network-Enhanced Model Predictive Path Integral (IANN-MPPI) control, which
enables interactive trajectory planning by predicting how surrounding agents
may react to each control sequence sampled by MPPI. To improve performance in
structured lane environments, we introduce a spline-based prior for the MPPI
sampling distribution, enabling efficient lane-changing behavior. We evaluate
IANN-MPPI in a dense traffic merging scenario, demonstrating its ability to
perform efficient merging maneuvers. Our project website is available at

augmented generation), experimental systems, pilot deployments, and real-world
use cases. We highlight GAI's growing role in enabling underwater perception,
digital twin modeling, and autonomous planning for remotely operated vehicle

sensing, control, optimization, communication, and regulatory compliance.
Beyond technical capabilities, we analyze key limitations, including limited
data availability, real-time performance constraints, trust and explainability,
environmental costs, and regulatory uncertainty. This review positions GAI not
merely as a tool but as a critical enabler of smart, resilient, and
environmentally aligned aquaculture systems.

Abstract: High-risk traffic zones such as intersections are a major cause of
collisions. This study leverages deep generative models to enhance the safety
of autonomous vehicles in an intersection context. We train a 1000-step
denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate collision-causing sensor
noise sequences for an autonomous vehicle navigating a four-way intersection
based on the current relative position and velocity of an intruder. Using the
generative adversarial architecture, the 1000-step model is distilled into a
single-step denoising diffusion model which demonstrates fast inference speed
while maintaining similar sampling quality. We demonstrate one possible
application of the single-step model in building a robust planner for the
autonomous vehicle. The planner uses the single-step model to efficiently
sample potential failure cases based on the currently measured traffic state to
inform its decision-making. Through simulation experiments, the robust planner
demonstrates significantly lower failure rate and delay rate compared with the
baseline Intelligent Driver Model controller.

Motivation: 人行道送货机器人是城市货运的可行方案，但因行人密度和基础设施变化导致的旅行时间不确定性影响了其效率，研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合优化与模拟，提出三种不确定性集构建方法（预算、椭球和SVC），以及一种分布鲁棒最短路径（SP）方法，用于解决路径规划问题。

Result: 鲁棒路径规划显著提升了操作可靠性，椭球和DRSP方法表现最佳，尤其在机器人设计保守或环境恶劣时效果更明显。

Conclusion: 鲁棒路径规划能有效提升人行道机器人在复杂环境中的效率，尤其是在恶劣天气和高行人密度情况下。

Abstract: Sidewalk delivery robots are a promising solution for urban freight
distribution, reducing congestion compared to trucks and providing a safer,
higher-capacity alternative to drones. However, unreliable travel times on
sidewalks due to pedestrian density, obstacles, and varying infrastructure
conditions can significantly affect their efficiency. This study addresses the
robust route planning problem for sidewalk robots, explicitly accounting for
travel time uncertainty due to varying sidewalk conditions. Optimization is
integrated with simulation to reproduce the effect of obstacles and pedestrian
flows and generate realistic travel times. The study investigates three
different approaches to derive uncertainty sets, including budgeted,
ellipsoidal, and support vector clustering (SVC)-based methods, along with a
distributionally robust method to solve the shortest path (SP) problem. A
realistic case study reproducing pedestrian patterns in Stockholm's city center
is used to evaluate the efficiency of robust routing across various robot
designs and environmental conditions. The results show that, when compared to a
conventional SP, robust routing significantly enhances operational reliability
under variable sidewalk conditions. The Ellipsoidal and DRSP approaches
outperform the other methods, yielding the most efficient paths in terms of
average and worst-case delay. Sensitivity analyses reveal that robust
approaches consistently outperform the conventional SP, particularly for
sidewalk delivery robots that are wider, slower, and have more conservative
navigation behaviors. These benefits are even more pronounced in adverse
weather conditions and high pedestrian congestion scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is an important component for precision
agriculture in orchards, as it allows autonomous robots to perform tasks like
targeted operations or individual tree monitoring. However, creating these maps
is challenging because GPS signals are often unreliable under dense tree
canopies. Furthermore, standard Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
approaches struggle in orchards because the repetitive appearance of trees can
confuse the system, leading to mapping errors. To address this, we introduce
Tree-SLAM, a semantic SLAM approach tailored for creating maps of individual
trees in orchards. Utilizing RGB-D images, our method detects tree trunks with
an instance segmentation model, estimates their location and re-identifies them
using a cascade-graph-based data association algorithm. These re-identified
trunks serve as landmarks in a factor graph framework that integrates noisy GPS
signals, odometry, and trunk observations. The system produces maps of
individual trees with a geo-localization error as low as 18 cm, which is less
than 20\% of the planting distance. The proposed method was validated on
diverse datasets from apple and pear orchards across different seasons,
demonstrating high mapping accuracy and robustness in scenarios with unreliable
GPS signals.

Conclusion: 该框架支持对人行道条件和行人行为的持续监测，有助于建设更宜步行、包容和反应灵敏的城市环境。

Abstract: Walkability is a key component of sustainable urban development, while
collecting detailed data on its related features remains challenging due to the
high costs and limited scalability of traditional methods. Sidewalk delivery
robots, increasingly deployed in urban environments, offer a promising solution
to these limitations. This paper explores how these robots can serve as mobile
data collection platforms, capturing sidewalk-level features related to
walkability in a scalable, automated, and real-time manner. A sensor-equipped
robot was deployed on a sidewalk network at KTH in Stockholm, completing 101
trips covering 900 segments. From the collected data, different typologies of
features are derived, including robot trip characteristics (e.g., speed,
duration), sidewalk conditions (e.g., width, surface unevenness), and sidewalk
utilization (e.g., pedestrian density). Their walkability-related implications
were investigated with a series of analyses. The results demonstrate that
pedestrian movement patterns are strongly influenced by sidewalk
characteristics, with higher density, reduced width, and surface irregularity
associated with slower and more variable trajectories. Notably, robot speed
closely mirrors pedestrian behavior, highlighting its potential as a proxy for
assessing pedestrian dynamics. The proposed framework enables continuous
monitoring of sidewalk conditions and pedestrian behavior, contributing to the
development of more walkable, inclusive, and responsive urban environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为自主系统的稳健部署提供了有力支持。

Abstract: As industrial autonomous ground vehicles are increasingly deployed in
safety-critical environments, ensuring their safe operation under diverse
conditions is paramount. This paper presents a novel approach for their safety
verification based on systematic situation extraction, probabilistic modelling
and verification. We build upon the concept of a situation coverage grid, which
exhaustively enumerates environmental configurations relevant to the vehicle's
operation. This grid is augmented with quantitative probabilistic data
collected from situation-based system testing, capturing probabilistic
transitions between situations. We then generate a probabilistic model that
encodes the dynamics of both normal and unsafe system behaviour. Safety
properties extracted from hazard analysis and formalised in temporal logic are
verified through probabilistic model checking against this model. The results
demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies high-risk situations,
provides quantitative safety guarantees, and supports compliance with
regulatory standards, thereby contributing to the robust deployment of
autonomous systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为多智能体交互轨迹规划提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，适用于复杂不确定性环境。

Abstract: Trajectory planning involving multi-agent interactions has been a
long-standing challenge in the field of robotics, primarily burdened by the
inherent yet intricate interactions among agents. While game-theoretic methods
are widely acknowledged for their effectiveness in managing multi-agent
interactions, significant impediments persist when it comes to accommodating
the intentional uncertainties of agents. In the context of intentional
uncertainties, the heavy computational burdens associated with existing
game-theoretic methods are induced, leading to inefficiencies and poor
scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic interactive
trajectory planning method to effectively address the intentional uncertainties
of agents, and it demonstrates both high efficiency and enhanced scalability.
As the underpinning basis, we model the interactions between agents under
intentional uncertainties as a general Bayesian game, and we show that its
agent-form equivalence can be represented as a potential game under certain
minor assumptions. The existence and attainability of the optimal interactive
trajectories are illustrated, as the corresponding Bayesian Nash equilibrium
can be attained by optimizing a unified optimization problem. Additionally, we
present a distributed algorithm based on the dual consensus alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the parallel solving of the
problem, thereby significantly improving the scalability. The attendant
outcomes from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
is effective across a range of scenarios characterized by general forms of
intentional uncertainties. Its scalability surpasses that of existing
centralized and decentralized baselines, allowing for real-time interactive
trajectory planning in uncertain game settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LGL方法仅考虑部分LiDAR数据或适用于单一传感器，忽视了均匀性问题。

Method: 将点云编码为空间和强度BEV图像，设计多BEV融合网络和视点不变性假设，实现特征提取和全局定位。

Result: 实验表明UniLGL在真实环境中优于其他方法，并成功部署于多种平台。

Conclusion: UniLGL在多场景中表现优异，适用于工业和野外任务。

Abstract: Existing LGL methods typically consider only partial information (e.g.,
geometric features) from LiDAR observations or are designed for homogeneous
LiDAR sensors, overlooking the uniformity in LGL. In this work, a uniform LGL
method is proposed, termed UniLGL, which simultaneously achieves spatial and
material uniformity, as well as sensor-type uniformity. The key idea of the
proposed method is to encode the complete point cloud, which contains both
geometric and material information, into a pair of BEV images (i.e., a spatial
BEV image and an intensity BEV image). An end-to-end multi-BEV fusion network
is designed to extract uniform features, equipping UniLGL with spatial and
material uniformity. To ensure robust LGL across heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, a
viewpoint invariance hypothesis is introduced, which replaces the conventional
translation equivariance assumption commonly used in existing LPR networks and
supervises UniLGL to achieve sensor-type uniformity in both global descriptors
and local feature representations. Finally, based on the mapping between local
features on the 2D BEV image and the point cloud, a robust global pose
estimator is derived that determines the global minimum of the global pose on
SE(3) without requiring additional registration. To validate the effectiveness
of the proposed uniform LGL, extensive benchmarks are conducted in real-world
environments, and the results show that the proposed UniLGL is demonstratively
competitive compared to other State-of-the-Art LGL methods. Furthermore, UniLGL
has been deployed on diverse platforms, including full-size trucks and agile
Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), to enable high-precision localization and mapping
as well as multi-MAV collaborative exploration in port and forest environments,
demonstrating the applicability of UniLGL in industrial and field scenarios.

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在空间推理、约束遵循和多模态集成方面存在局限性，需进一步改进以适应复杂任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for enhancing robotic path
planning. This paper assesses visual input's utility for multimodal LLMs in
such tasks via a comprehensive benchmark. We evaluated 15 multimodal LLMs on
generating valid and optimal paths in 2D grid environments, simulating
simplified robotic planning, comparing text-only versus text-plus-visual inputs
across varying model sizes and grid complexities. Our results indicate moderate
success rates on simpler small grids, where visual input or few-shot text
prompting offered some benefits. However, performance significantly degraded on
larger grids, highlighting a scalability challenge. While larger models
generally achieved higher average success, the visual modality was not
universally dominant over well-structured text for these multimodal systems,
and successful paths on simpler grids were generally of high quality. These
results indicate current limitations in robust spatial reasoning, constraint
adherence, and scalable multimodal integration, identifying areas for future
LLM development in robotic path planning.

Abstract: We consider manipulation problems in constrained and cluttered settings,
which require several regrasps at unknown locations. We propose to inform an

provide the solver with guesses for the mode switches and additional
constraints for the object placements. By interleaving the creation of regrasp
maps, their adaptation based on failed refinements, and solving TAMP
(sub)problems, we are able to provide a robust search method for challenging
regrasp manipulation problems.

Abstract: Real robot data collection for imitation learning has led to significant
advancements in robotic manipulation. However, the requirement for robot
hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this
paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric
human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but
more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on
human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse
Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We
fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the
robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Isaac
Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation
tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Isaac Humanoid

ablate the importance of human data. Videos can be found on our website:

Conclusion: 研究避免了依赖平均场博弈模型，实现了对玩家数N完全均匀的分析，进一步建立了有限时域和遍历游戏平衡对的均匀turnpike性质。

Abstract: We consider the long-time behavior of equilibrium strategies and state
trajectories in a linear quadratic $N$-player game with Gaussian initial data.
By analyzing convergence toward the corresponding ergodic game, we establish
exponential convergence estimates between the solutions of the finite-horizon
Riccati system and the associated algebraic Riccati system arising in the
ergodic setting. Building on these results, we prove the convergence of the
time-averaged value function and derive a turnpike property for the equilibrium
pairs of each player. Importantly, our approach avoids reliance on the mean
field game limiting model, allowing for a fully uniform analysis with respect
to the number of players $N$. As a result, we further establish a uniform
turnpike property for the equilibrium pairs between the finite-horizon and
ergodic games with $N$ players.

develop the algorithm converging to Nash equilibria in games, where players

neighbors over some communication graph. The convergence rate is demonstrated
to be geometric and improves the rates obtained by the previously presented
procedures seeking Nash equilibria in the class of games under consideration.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of convex composite optimization problems. We
begin by characterizing the equivalence between the primal/dual strong

Building on this foundation, we derive a specific set of equivalent conditions
for the perturbation analysis of the problem. Furthermore, we employ the

strict Robinson constraint qualification, as well as the equivalence between
the dual nondegeneracy condition and the nonsingularity of Clarke's generalized

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实验上均表现出色，适用于高维问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we present enhanced analysis for sign-based optimization
algorithms with momentum updates. Traditional sign-based methods, under the
separable smoothness assumption, guarantee a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/4})$, but they either require large batch sizes or assume
unimodal symmetric stochastic noise. To address these limitations, we
demonstrate that signSGD with momentum can achieve the same convergence rate
using constant batch sizes without additional assumptions. Our analysis, under
the standard $l_2$-smoothness condition, improves upon the result of the prior
momentum-based signSGD method by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2})$, where $d$
is the problem dimension. Furthermore, we explore sign-based methods with
majority vote in distributed settings and show that the proposed momentum-based
method yields convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}\left( d^{1/2}T^{-1/2} +
dn^{-1/2} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( \max \{ d^{1/4}T^{-1/4},
d^{1/10}T^{-1/5} \} \right)$, which outperform the previous results of
$\mathcal{O}\left( dT^{-1/4} + dn^{-1/2} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left(

the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: Quantum computers promise to outperform their classical counterparts at
certain tasks. However, existing quantum devices are error-prone and restricted
in size. Thus, effective compilation methods are crucial to exploit limited
quantum resources. In this work, we address the problem of qubit routing for
commuting gates, which arises, for example, during the compilation of the
well-known Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. We propose a two-step

return an optimal solution. To justify the use of integer programming, we prove
NP-hardness of the underlying optimization problem. Furthermore, we derive
asymptotic upper and lower bounds on the quality of a solution. We develop
several integer programming models and derive linear descriptions of related
polytopes, which generalize to applications beyond this work. Finally, we
conduct a computational study showing that our approach outperforms existing

Conclusion: 优化视角不仅解决了熵正则化最优传输问题，还为动态薛定谔桥问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we develop a collection of novel methods for the
entropic-regularised optimal transport problem, which are inspired by existing
mirror descent interpretations of the Sinkhorn algorithm used for solving this
problem. These are fundamentally proposed from an optimisation perspective:
either based on the associated semi-dual problem, or based on solving a
non-convex constrained problem over subset of joint distributions. This
optimisation viewpoint results in non-asymptotic rates of convergence for the
proposed methods under minimal assumptions on the problem structure. We also
propose a momentum-equipped method with provable accelerated guarantees through
this viewpoint, akin to those in the Euclidean setting. The broader framework
we develop based on optimisation over the joint distributions also finds an
analogue in the dynamical Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem.

Motivation: 研究在概率测度空间上的梯度流收敛性，特别是在目标函数不具有位移凸性的情况下，探讨扩散如何促进收敛。

Result: 证明了在适当假设下，目标函数的次优性间隙以O(1/t)速率减少；在强凸情况下，收敛速率可更快。

Conclusion: 结果扩展了具有定量收敛保证的均值场Langevin动力学的范围，并为概率测度空间上的优化提供了新应用。

Abstract: We study the quantitative convergence of drift-diffusion PDEs that arise as
Wasserstein gradient flows of linearly convex functions over the space of
probability measures on ${\mathbb R}^d$. In this setting, the objective is in
general not displacement convex, so it is not clear a priori whether global
convergence even holds. Still, our analysis reveals that diffusion {allows} a
favorable interaction between Wasserstein geometry and linear convexity,
leading to a general quantitative convergence theory, analogous to that of
gradient flows in convex settings in the Euclidean space.
  Specifically, we prove that if the objective is convex and suitably coercive,
the suboptimality gap decreases at a rate $O(1/t)$. This improves to a rate
faster than any polynomial -- or even exponential in compact settings -- when
the objective is strongly convex relative to the entropy.
  Our results extend the range of mean-field Langevin dynamics that enjoy
quantitative convergence guarantees, and enable new applications to
optimization over the space of probability measures. To illustrate this, we
show quantitative convergence results for the minimization of
entropy-regularized nonconvex problems, we propose and study an
\emph{approximate Fisher Information} regularization covered by our setting,
and we apply our results to an estimator for trajectory inference which
involves the minimization of the relative entropy with respect to the Wiener
measure in path space.

Abstract: We study the feedback stabilization of the McKean-Vlasov PDE on the torus.
Our goal is to steer the dynamics toward a prescribed stationary distribution
or accelerate convergence to it using a time-dependent control potential. We
reformulate the controlled PDE in a weighted-projected space and apply the
ground-state transform to obtain a Schrodinger-type operator. The resulting
operator framework enables spectral analysis, verification of the
infinite-dimensional Hautus test, and the construction of Riccati-based
feedback laws. We rigorously prove local exponential stabilization via maximal
regularity arguments and nonlinear estimates. Numerical experiments on
well-studied models (the noisy Kuramoto model for synchronization, the O(2)
spin model in a magnetic field, and the Gaussian/von Mises attractive
interaction potential) showcase the effectiveness of our control strategy,
demonstrating convergence speed-ups and stabilization of otherwise unstable
equilibria.

Abstract: Quasi-differentiable functions were introduced by Pshenichnyi in a 1969
monograph written in Russian and translated in an English version in 1971. This
class of nonsmooth functions was studied extensively in two decades since but
has not received much attention in today's wide optimization literature. This
regrettable omission is in spite of the fact that many functions in modern day
applications of optimization can be shown to be quasi-differentiable. In
essence, a quasi-differentiable function is one whose directional derivative at
an arbitrary reference vector, as a function of the direction, is the
difference of two positively homogenous, convex functions. Thus, to bring
quasi-differentiable functions closer to the class of difference-of-convex
functions that has received fast growing attention in recent years in
connection with many applied subjects, we propose to rename
quasi-differentiable functions as quasi-difference-convex (quasi-dc) functions.
Besides modernizing and advancing this class of nonconvex and nondifferentiable
functions, our research aims to put together a unified treatment of iterative
convex-programming based descent algorithms for solving a broad class of
composite quasi-dc programs and to establish their subsequential convergence,
sequential convergence, and rates of convergence; the latter two topics are in
line with the modern focus of such analysis for convex programs and some
extensions and are departures from the sole emphasis of subsequential
convergence in the traditional studies of quasi-differentiable optimization.
Through this research, we have gained significant new insights and
understanding, advanced the fundamentals, and broadened the applications of
this neglected yet pervasive class of nonconvex and nondifferentiable functions
and their optimization.

Abstract: In automated driving, risk describes potential harm to passengers of an
autonomous vehicle (AV) and other road users. Recent studies suggest that
human-like driving behavior emerges from embedding risk in AV motion planning
algorithms. Additionally, providing evidence that risk is minimized during the
AV operation is essential to vehicle safety certification. However, there has
yet to be a consensus on how to define and operationalize risk in motion
planning or how to bound or minimize it during operation. In this paper, we
define a stochastic risk measure and introduce it as a constraint into both
robust and stochastic nonlinear model predictive path-following controllers
(RMPC and SMPC respectively). We compare the vehicle's behavior arising from
employing SMPC and RMPC with respect to safety and path-following performance.
Further, the implementation of an automated driving example is provided,
showcasing the effects of different risk tolerances and uncertainty growths in
predictions of other road users for both cases. We find that the RMPC is
significantly more conservative than the SMPC, while also displaying greater
following errors towards references. Further, the RMPCs behavior cannot be
considered as human-like. Moreover, unlike SMPC, the RMPC cannot account for
different risk tolerances. The RMPC generates undesired driving behavior for
even moderate uncertainties, which are handled better by the SMPC.
