While\nKoopman operator theory offers a framework for deploying powerful linear\ncontrol techniques, learning a finite-dimensional invariant subspace for\nhigh-fidelity modeling continues to be an open problem.

A multi-step\nprediction loss is utilized during training to ensure long-horizon prediction\ncapability.

Leveraging smart charge scheduling and\nVehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technologies offers opportunities to adjust charge\nschedules, allowing for load shifting and grid support, which can reduce both\ncharging costs and grid stress. In this work, we develop a charge scheduling\noptimization method that can be used to assess the impact of spatial power\ncapacity constraints and real-time price profiles. We formulate a mixed-integer\nlinear programming problem to minimize overall charging costs, taking into\naccount factors such as time-varying EV locations, EV charging requirements,\nand local power demands across different zones.

While much of today's research on robotic intelligence\nfocuses on generating better controllers, inventing smarter tools offers a\ncomplementary form of physical intelligence: shifting the onus of\nproblem-solving onto the tool's design. Given the vast and impressive\ncommon-sense, reasoning, and creative capabilities of today's foundation\nmodels, we investigate whether these models can provide useful priors to\nautomatically design and effectively wield such tools?

We\nevaluate VLMgineer on a diverse new benchmark of everyday manipulation\nscenarios that demand creative tool design and use.

As a pilot study, we evaluate our approach on data collected across\nmultiple terrain types and speeds and demonstrate generalization to previously\nunseen conditions.

In this paper, we propose a novel visual\nand repeat robotic autonomous navigation method that requires no accurate\nlocalization and dense reconstruction modules, which makes our system featured\nby lightweight and robustness. Firstly, feature flow is introduced and we\ndevelop a qualitative mapping between feature flow and robot's motion, in which\nfeature flow is defined as pixel location bias between matched features. Based\non the mapping model, the map outputted by the teaching phase is represented as\na keyframe graph, in which the feature flow on the edge encodes the relative\nmotion between adjacent keyframes. Secondly, the visual repeating navigation is\nessentially modeled as a feature flow minimization problem between current\nobservation and the map keyframe.

This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied\nQuestion Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past\nexperiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,\ntemporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a\nstructured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from\ncognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based\nworld instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables\ntargeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the\nexploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping\ncriteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information.

In this paper, we focus on two\ntypes of gradient noises: one is sub-Weibull noise, and the other is noise\nunder the assumption that it has a bounded $p$-th central moment ($p$-BCM) with\n$p\\in (1, 2]$. The latter is more challenging due to the occurrence of infinite\nvariance when $p\\in (1, 2)$. Under these two gradient noise assumptions, the\nin-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs have been extensively\nstudied in the contexts of convex optimization and standard smooth\noptimization. However, for weakly convex objectives-a class that includes all\nLipschitz-continuous convex objectives and smooth objectives-our understanding\nof the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs under these two\ntypes of noises remains incomplete. We investigate the high-probability\nconvergence of the vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) method under\nsub-Weibull noises, as well as the high-probability and in-expectation\nconvergence of clipped SsGD under the $p$-BCM noises.

Traditionally, methods such as manual counting,\nloop detectors, pneumatic road tubes, and camera-based recognition have been\nused for TMC estimation.

This\npaper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a\ndual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC\nestimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to\nclassify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and\nvehicle classes.

A main reason for this success is the ability of\nLLMs to perform in-context learning, which, however, strongly relies on the\ndesign of task examples, closely related to the target tasks. Consequently,\nemploying LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task\nexamples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained\nengineers. Furthermore, there is often no principled way to evaluate for\nhallucination before task execution. To address these challenges, we propose\nDEMONSTRATE, a novel methodology that avoids the use of LLMs for complex\noptimization problem generations, and instead only relies on the embedding\nrepresentations of task descriptions. To do this, we leverage tools from\ninverse optimal control to replace in-context prompt examples with task\ndemonstrations, as well as the concept of multitask learning, which ensures\ntarget and example task similarity by construction. Given the fact that\nhardware demonstrations can easily be collected using teleoperation or guidance\nof the robot, our approach significantly reduces the reliance on engineering\nexpertise for designing in-context examples. Furthermore, the enforced\nmultitask structure enables learning from few demonstrations and assessment of\nhallucinations prior to task execution.

Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into\nautonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in\nOOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD\nscenarios and generate user-level decisions such as \"go straight\" or \"turn\nright.\" However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between\nthe VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and\nthe low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions.

Building on\nan existing framework for identifying degradation modes, we propose involving\ndomain, sensor, and safety experts, and incorporating Operational Design Domain\nspecifications to extend the degradation model by incorporating noise factors\nrelevant to AI performance. Situation coverage analysis is then applied to\nidentify representative operational contexts. This work marks an initial step\ntoward integrating noise factor analysis and situational coverage to support\nprincipled formulation and completeness assessment of robustness requirements\nfor camera-based AI perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76f8\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u56e0\u5b50\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5730\u5236\u5b9aAI\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u6c7d\u8f66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cAI\u673a\u5668\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u9700\u8981\u5b89\u5168\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9000\u5316\u4f1a\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cdAI\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\u5236\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u573a\u666f\u590d\u6742\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u60c5\u5883\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57df\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u60c5\u5883\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u566a\u58f0\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u6790\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u673a\u7684AI\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aAI\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u5236\u5b9a\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6c7d\u8f66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This paper proposes ZipMPC, a method that imitates\na long-horizon MPC behaviour by learning a compressed and context-dependent\ncost function for a short-horizon MPC. It improves performance over alternative\nmethods, such as approximate explicit MPC and automatic cost parameter tuning,\nin particular in terms of i) optimizing the long term objective; ii)\nmaintaining computational costs comparable to a short-horizon MPC; iii)\nensuring constraint satisfaction; and iv) generalizing control behaviour to\nenvironments not observed during training. For this purpose, ZipMPC leverages\nthe concept of differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients\nof the imitation loss through the MPC optimization. We validate our proposed\nmethod in simulation and real-world experiments on autonomous racing. ZipMPC\nconsistently completes laps faster than selected baselines, achieving lap times\nclose to the long-horizon MPC baseline.

Informative planning is an important part of RIG where the goal is to\nfind sequences of actions or paths that maximize efficiency or the quality of\ninformation collected. Many existing solutions solve this problem by assuming\nthat the environment is known in advance. However, real environments could be\nunknown or time-varying, and adaptive informative planning remains an active\narea of research. Adaptive planning and incremental online mapping are required\nfor mapping initially unknown or varying spatial fields. Gaussian process (GP)\nregression is a widely used technique in RIG for mapping continuous spatial\nfields. However, it falls short in many applications as its real-time\nperformance does not scale well to large datasets. To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes an efficient adaptive informative planning approach for\nmapping continuous scalar fields with GPs with streaming sparse GPs.

However, the performance of these policies is heavily\ndependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive\ndata collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data\ncollection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging\nexisting or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as\npublic robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human\ndata from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic\nflow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model\n(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of\nrobot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent\nPolicy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by\nsearching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real\nworld experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of\npolicies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement\nwith 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50\ndemonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand\nepisodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different\nrobots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u591a\u8bbe\u5907\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5149\u6d41\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u641c\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u6216\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u591a\u8bbe\u5907\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u5907\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08WM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u5907\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08LPS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728WM\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684WM\u540e\uff0c\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0830\u6b21\u793a\u8303\u65f6\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u8d8550%\uff0c50\u6b21\u793a\u8303\u65f6\u8d8520%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8bbe\u5907\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
