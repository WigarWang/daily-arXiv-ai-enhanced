### [1] [Learning to Quantize and Precode in Massive MIMO Systems for Energy Reduction: a Graph Neural Network Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10634)
*Thomas Feys,Liesbet Van der Perre,François Rottenberg*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文研究了大规模MIMO系统中非线性质化预编码问题，提出了一种图神经网络（GNN）以直接输出量化预编码向量，通过自监督训练最大化可达速率，并采用Gumbel-softmax梯度估计解决了目标函数不可微问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模MIMO系统的射频链数量增加、载波频率提高和带宽增大，数模转换器（DACs）成为硬件复杂性和功耗的瓶颈。

Method: 提出一种GNN模型，通过自监督训练直接输出量化预编码向量，并使用Gumbel-softmax梯度估计解决目标函数不可微问题。

Result: 在粗量化条件下，方法显著提高了可达总速率，例如在单用户情况下，使用1比特DACs即可达到与3比特DACs的MRT相同速率，降低DACs功耗4-7倍（基带）或3倍（射频）。

Conclusion: 该方法在降低DACs功耗方面效果显著，但增加了数字信号处理功耗，总体功耗在特定带宽下仍具优势。

Abstract: Massive MIMO systems are moving toward increased numbers of radio frequency
chains, higher carrier frequencies and larger bandwidths. As such,
digital-to-analog converters (DACs) are becoming a bottleneck in terms of
hardware complexity and power consumption. In this work, non-linear precoding
for coarsely quantized downlink massive MIMO is studied. Given the NP-hard
nature of this problem, a graph neural network (GNN) is proposed that directly
outputs the precoded quantized vector based on the channel matrix and the
intended transmit symbols. The model is trained in a self-supervised manner, by
directly maximizing the achievable rate. To overcome the non-differentiability
of the objective function, introduced due to the non-differentiable DAC
functions, a straight-through Gumbel-softmax estimation of the gradient is
proposed. The proposed method achieves a significant increase in achievable sum
rate under coarse quantization. For instance, in the single-user case, the
proposed method can achieve the same sum rate as maximum ratio transmission
(MRT) by using one-bit DAC's as compared to 3 bits for MRT. This reduces the
DAC's power consumption by a factor 4-7 and 3 for baseband and RF DACs
respectively. This, however, comes at the cost of increased digital signal
processing power consumption. When accounting for this, the reduction in
overall power consumption holds for a system bandwidth up to 3.5 MHz for
baseband DACs, while the RF DACs can maintain a power reduction of 2.9 for
higher bandwidths. Notably, indirect effects, which further reduce the power
consumption, such as a reduced fronthaul consumption and reduction in other
components, are not considered in this analysis.

### [2] [Data-Driven Safety Certificates of Infinite Networks with Unknown Models and Interconnection Topologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10979)
*Mahdieh Zaker,Amy Nejati,Abolfazl Lavaei*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于数据驱动的方法，用于对具有未知模型和拓扑结构的无限网络进行安全性认证，通过子系统存储证书的联合耗散性特性，降低了传统方法的计算复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于无限网络的子系统数量无限且拓扑结构未知，现有的有限网络分析方法无法适用，因此需要一种新的数据驱动方法来验证其安全性。

Method: 利用子系统的存储证书和耗散性特性，提出了一种组合数据驱动条件，构建无限网络的屏障证书，无需精确了解拓扑结构。

Conclusion: 组合数据驱动方法为无限网络的安全性认证提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Infinite networks are complex interconnected systems comprising a countably
infinite number of subsystems, where counting them precisely poses a
significant challenge due to the seemingly endless interconnected nature of the
network (e.g., counting vehicles on the road). In such scenarios, the presence
of infinitely many subsystems within the network renders the existing analysis
frameworks tailored for finite networks inapplicable to infinite ones. This
paper is concerned with offering a data-driven approach, within a compositional
framework, for the safety certification of infinite networks with both unknown
mathematical models and interconnection topologies. Given the immense
computational complexity stemming from the extensive dimension of infinite
networks, our approach capitalizes on the joint dissipativity-type properties
of subsystems, characterized by storage certificates. We introduce innovative
compositional data-driven conditions to construct a barrier certificate for the
infinite network leveraging storage certificates of its unknown subsystems
derived from data, while offering correctness guarantees across the network
safety. We demonstrate that our compositional data-driven reasoning eliminates
the requirement for checking the traditional dissipativity condition, which
typically mandates precise knowledge of the interconnection topology. In
addition, while existing data-driven literature demonstrates an exponential
trend in sample complexity with respect to network size, we showcase that our
compositional strategy notably reduces it to a linear scale in terms of the
number of subsystems. We illustrate our data-driven results on two physical
infinite networks with unknown models and interconnection topologies.

### [3] [Approximate solutions to games of ordered preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11021)
*Pau de las Heras Molins,Eric Roy-Almonacid,Dong Ho Lee,Lasse Peters,David Fridovich-Keil,Georgios Bakirtzis*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为“基于时间的字典序迭代最佳响应（lexicographic IBR over time）”的解决方案，用于处理有序偏好博弈中的计算复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要平衡多个优先目标（如最短行驶时间、安全性和交通协调），而有序偏好博弈可以有效建模这些交互，但随着时间范围、参与者数量或偏好等级的增加，计算变得难以处理。

Method: 论文引入了“基于时间的字典序迭代最佳响应”方法，通过在滚动时间框架内近似解决方案，利用过去信息加速收敛。

Result: 模拟交通场景显示，该方法能够有效计算近似最优解，并收敛于广义纳什均衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决有序偏好博弈中的复杂性问题提供了一种高效的计算策略。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must balance ranked objectives, such as minimizing travel
time, ensuring safety, and coordinating with traffic. Games of ordered
preference effectively model these interactions but become computationally
intractable as the time horizon, number of players, or number of preference
levels increase. While receding horizon frameworks mitigate long-horizon
intractability by solving sequential shorter games, often warm-started, they do
not resolve the complexity growth inherent in existing methods for solving
games of ordered preference. This paper introduces a solution strategy that
avoids excessive complexity growth by approximating solutions using
lexicographic iterated best response (IBR) in receding horizon, termed
"lexicographic IBR over time." Lexicographic IBR over time uses past
information to accelerate convergence. We demonstrate through simulated traffic
scenarios that lexicographic IBR over time efficiently computes
approximate-optimal solutions for receding horizon games of ordered preference,
converging towards generalized Nash equilibria.

### [4] [Standards-Compliant DM-RS Allocation via Temporal Channel Prediction for Massive MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11064)
*Sehyun Ryu,Hyun Jong Yang*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于信道预测的参考信号分配（CPRS）方法，通过联合优化信道预测和DM-RS分配，在不依赖CSI反馈的情况下提升数据吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络中反馈开销的增加是一个关键挑战，尤其在FDD系统中的大规模MIMO系统。现有的CSI压缩和预测研究未能充分解决参考信号分配的优化问题。

Method: 提出了CPRS方法，采用ViViT/CNN架构，将时变的CSI矩阵视为图像序列数据，实现高效且自适应的传输。

Result: 通过NVIDIA Sionna的射线追踪信道数据进行仿真，结果显示吞吐量比基准策略提升了36.60%。

Conclusion: CPRS方法有效解决了参考信号分配问题，为动态环境下的高效传输提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reducing feedback overhead in beyond 5G networks is a critical challenge, as
the growing number of antennas in modern massive MIMO systems substantially
increases the channel state information (CSI) feedback demand in frequency
division duplex (FDD) systems. To address this, extensive research has focused
on CSI compression and prediction, with neural network-based approaches gaining
momentum and being considered for integration into the 3GPP 5G-Advanced
standards. While deep learning has been effectively applied to CSI-limited
beamforming and handover optimization, reference signal allocation under such
constraints remains surprisingly underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce
the concept of channel prediction-based reference signal allocation (CPRS),
which jointly optimizes channel prediction and DM-RS allocation to improve data
throughput without requiring CSI feedback. We further propose a
standards-compliant ViViT/CNN-based architecture that implements CPRS by
treating evolving CSI matrices as sequential image-like data, enabling
efficient and adaptive transmission in dynamic environments. Simulation results
using ray-tracing channel data generated in NVIDIA Sionna validate the proposed
method, showing up to 36.60% throughput improvement over benchmark strategies.

### [5] [Optimal Honeypot Ratio and Convergent Fictitious-Play Learning in Signaling Games for CPS Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11113)
*Yueyue Xu,Yuewei Chen,Lin Wang,Zhaoyang Cheng,Xiaoming Hu*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文通过建模蜜罐部署为伽马固定信号博弈，提出了一种有效的网络防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对网络物理系统（CPS）日益增长的攻击威胁，研究如何通过蜜罐部署实现主动防御。

Method: 将蜜罐部署建模为伽马固定信号博弈，定义伽马完美贝叶斯-纳什均衡（gamma-PBNE），并通过离散时间虚构博弈算法结合贝叶斯信念更新与经验最佳响应。

Result: 揭示了三种依赖先验蜜罐比率的均衡状态，并找到了能最大化网络平均效用的最优蜜罐比率与信号策略。

Conclusion: 该方法在数值实验中显示出有效性，适用于CPS防御。

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are facing a fast-growing wave of attacks. To
achieve effective proactive defense, this paper models honeypot deployment as a
gamma-fixed signaling game in which node liveness serves as the only signal and
normal-node signal gamma is exogenously fixed. We define the gamma-perfect
Bayesian-Nash equilibrium (gamma-PBNE). Analytical expressions are obtained for
all gamma-PBNEs, revealing three distinct equilibrium regimes that depend on
the priori honeypot ratio. Furthermore, the optimal honeypot ratio and
signaling strategy that jointly maximize the network average utility are
obtained. To capture strategic interaction over time, we develop a
discrete-time fictitious-play algorithm that couples Bayesian belief updates
with empirical best responses. We prove that, as long as the honeypot ratio is
perturbed within a non-degenerate neighbourhood of the optimum, every
fictitious-play path converges to the defender-optimal gamma-PBNE. Numerical
results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate its
applicability to CPS defense.

### [6] [Optimal Sensor Scheduling and Selection for Continuous-Discrete Kalman Filtering with Auxiliary Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11240)
*Mohamad Al Ahdab,John Leth,Zheng-Hua Tan*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文研究了连续-离散卡尔曼滤波（CD-KF）在多传感器、不规则测量下的状态空间模型（SSMs）中的应用，并提出了基于泊松过程的测量率优化框架，提高了资源利用和估计精度的平衡。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决多传感器系统中测量率与辅助状态动态耦合的优化问题，旨在提高滤波性能的同时降低资源消耗。

Method: 方法包括建立测量事件的独立泊松过程模型，推导后验协方差矩阵的上界，并提出基于梯度的有限时域最优控制框架来联合优化测量率和辅助状态动态。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在状态空间滤波和动态时间高斯过程回归中显著改善了资源使用与估计精度的权衡。

Conclusion: 结论表明，该优化框架有效解决了多传感器系统中的资源约束问题，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the Continuous-Discrete Kalman Filter (CD-KF) for State-Space Models
(SSMs) where continuous-time dynamics are observed via multiple sensors with
discrete, irregularly timed measurements. Our focus extends to scenarios in
which the measurement process is coupled with the states of an auxiliary SSM.
For instance, higher measurement rates may increase energy consumption or heat
generation, while a sensor's accuracy can depend on its own spatial trajectory
or that of the measured target. Each sensor thus carries distinct costs and
constraints associated with its measurement rate and additional constraints and
costs on the auxiliary state. We model measurement occurrences as independent
Poisson processes with sensor-specific rates and derive an upper bound on the
mean posterior covariance matrix of the CD-KF along the mean auxiliary state.
The bound is continuously differentiable with respect to the measurement rates,
which enables efficient gradient-based optimization. Exploiting this bound, we
propose a finite-horizon optimal control framework to optimize measurement
rates and auxiliary-state dynamics jointly. We further introduce a
deterministic method for scheduling measurement times from the optimized rates.
Empirical results in state-space filtering and dynamic temporal Gaussian
process regression demonstrate that our approach achieves improved trade-offs
between resource usage and estimation accuracy.

### [7] [Moving Beyond Marginal Carbon Intensity: A Poor Metric for Both Carbon Accounting and Grid Flexibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11377)
*Philipp Wiesner,Odej Kao*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文认为边际碳强度（MCI）既不可靠也不实用，无法用于碳核算或电网灵活性优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MCI作为碳感知计算指标的局限性，并提出更实用的替代方案。

Method: 分析MCI的基本限制，包括不可观测性、依赖不透明预测模型以及缺乏可验证性。

Result: MCI无法反映高碳源导致的限制，也无法提供可用过剩电量的信息。

Conclusion: 建议研究更实用的指标，如直接报告过剩电量、明确建模储能和电网稳定性，并与新兴的可再生能源证书市场结合。

Abstract: Marginal Carbon Intensity (MCI) has been promoted as an effective metric for
carbon-aware computing. Although it is already considered as impractical for
carbon accounting purposes, many still view it as valuable when optimizing for
grid flexibility by incentivizing electricity usage during curtailment periods.
In this statement paper, we argue that MCI is neither reliable nor actionable
for either purpose. We outline its fundamental limitations, including
non-observability, reliance on opaque predictive models, and the lack of
verifiability. Moreover, MCI fails to reflect curtailment caused by high-carbon
sources and offers no insight into the quantity of available excess power. We
advocate moving beyond MCI and instead call for research on more actionable
metrics, such as direct reporting of excess power, explicit modeling of energy
storage and grid stability, and integration with emerging granular renewable
energy certificate markets.

Result: 仿真实验表明，该方法在噪声演示下优于传统松弛方法，提高了估计准确性。

Conclusion: 精确惩罚函数的引入显著提升了逆最优控制方法在噪声环境中的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Inverse optimal control (IOC) is a promising paradigm for learning and
mimicking optimal control strategies from capable demonstrators, or gaining a
deeper understanding of their intentions, by estimating an unknown objective
function from one or more corresponding optimal control sequences. When
computing estimates from demonstrations in environments with safety-preserving
inequality constraints, acknowledging their presence in the chosen IOC method
is crucial given their strong influence on the final control strategy. However,
solution strategies capable of considering inequality constraints, such as the
inverse Karush-Kuhn-Tucker approach, rely on their correct activation and
fulfillment; a restrictive assumption when dealing with noisy demonstrations.
To overcome this problem, we leverage the concept of exact penalty functions
for IOC and show preservation of estimation accuracy. Considering noisy
demonstrations, we then illustrate how the usage of penalty functions reduces
the number of unknown variables and how their approximations enhance the
estimation method's capacity to account for wrong constraint activations within
a polytopic-constrained environment. The proposed method is evaluated for three
systems in simulation, outperforming traditional relaxation approaches for
noisy demonstrations.

### [9] [A Risk-Aware Adaptive Robust MPC with Learned Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11420)
*Mingcong Li*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文提出一种风险感知自适应鲁棒MPC框架，结合学习和调节机制解决非稳态不确定性问题，降低保守性并满足机会约束。

Method: 采用双时间尺度架构，结合高斯过程回归和主动学习进行风险评估，动态调节安全边界。

Result: 理论证明满足递归可行性和机会约束，实验显示在非稳态参数下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAAR-MPC框架有效降低保守性，精准控制风险，且性能优于传统方法。

Abstract: Solving chance-constrained optimal control problems for systems subject to
non-stationary uncertainties is a significant challenge.Conventional robust
model predictive control (MPC) often yields excessive conservatism by relying
on static worst-case assumptions, while standard stochastic MPC methods
struggle when underlying uncertainty distributions are unknown a priori.This
article presents a Risk-Aware Adaptive Robust MPC (RAAR-MPC) framework,a
hierarchical architecture that systematically orchestrates a novel synthesis of
proactive, learning-based risk assessment and reactive risk regulation. The
framework employs a medium-frequency risk assessment engine, which leverages
Gaussian process regression and active learning, to construct a tight,
data-driven characterization of the prediction error set from operational
data.Concurrently, a low-timescale outer loop implements a self-correcting
update law for an adaptive safety margin to precisely regulate the empirical
risk and compensate for unmodeled dynamics.This dual-timescale adaptation
enables the system to rigorously satisfy chance constraints with a user-defined
probability, while minimizing the conservatism inherent in traditional
approaches.We formally establish that the interplay between these adaptive
components guarantees recursive feasibility and ensures the closed-loop system
satisfies the chance constraints up to a user-defined risk level with high
probability.Numerical experiments on a benchmark DC-DC converter under
non-stationary parametric uncertainties demonstrate that our framework
precisely achieves the target risk level, resulting in a significantly lower
average cost compared to state-of-the-art robust and stochastic MPC strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为OSMPs的新框架，通过结合学习的微分同胚编码器和超临界Hopf分岔，解决了传统动态运动基元在周期性行为和任务间插值方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态运动基元（DMPs）在捕捉复杂周期性行为和任务间插值方面存在不足，限制了其在实践中的广泛应用。

Method: 引入轨道稳定运动基元（OSMPs），结合学习的微分同胚编码器和超临界Hopf分岔，实现了周期性运动的准确学习，并提供了轨道稳定性和横向收缩的形式保证。

Conclusion: OSMPs框架为解决机器人学习中的周期性运动和任务间插值问题提供了有效的解决方案，并展示了广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Learning from demonstration provides a sample-efficient approach to acquiring
complex behaviors, enabling robots to move robustly, compliantly, and with
fluidity. In this context, Dynamic Motion Primitives offer built - in stability
and robustness to disturbances but often struggle to capture complex periodic
behaviors. Moreover, they are limited in their ability to interpolate between
different tasks. These shortcomings substantially narrow their applicability,
excluding a wide class of practically meaningful tasks such as locomotion and
rhythmic tool use. In this work, we introduce Orbitally Stable Motion
Primitives (OSMPs) - a framework that combines a learned diffeomorphic encoder
with a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in latent space, enabling the accurate
acquisition of periodic motions from demonstrations while ensuring formal
guarantees of orbital stability and transverse contraction. Furthermore, by
conditioning the bijective encoder on the task, we enable a single learned
policy to represent multiple motion objectives, yielding consistent zero-shot
generalization to unseen motion objectives within the training distribution. We
validate the proposed approach through extensive simulation and real-world
experiments across a diverse range of robotic platforms - from collaborative
arms and soft manipulators to a bio-inspired rigid-soft turtle robot -
demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines such as diffusion policies, among others.

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models represent a transformative shift in
robotics, with the aim of unifying visual perception, natural language
understanding, and embodied control within a single learning framework. This
review presents a comprehensive and forward-looking synthesis of the VLA
paradigm, with a particular emphasis on robotic manipulation and
instruction-driven autonomy. We comprehensively analyze 102 VLA models, 26
foundational datasets, and 12 simulation platforms that collectively shape the
development and evaluation of VLAs models. These models are categorized into
key architectural paradigms, each reflecting distinct strategies for
integrating vision, language, and control in robotic systems. Foundational
datasets are evaluated using a novel criterion based on task complexity,
variety of modalities, and dataset scale, allowing a comparative analysis of
their suitability for generalist policy learning. We introduce a
two-dimensional characterization framework that organizes these datasets based
on semantic richness and multimodal alignment, showing underexplored regions in
the current data landscape. Simulation environments are evaluated for their
effectiveness in generating large-scale data, as well as their ability to
facilitate transfer from simulation to real-world settings and the variety of
supported tasks. Using both academic and industrial contributions, we recognize
ongoing challenges and outline strategic directions such as scalable
pretraining protocols, modular architectural design, and robust multimodal
alignment strategies. This review serves as both a technical reference and a
conceptual roadmap for advancing embodiment and robotic control, providing
insights that span from dataset generation to real world deployment of
generalist robotic agents.

Abstract: Passive deformation due to compliance is a commonly used benefit of soft
robots, providing opportunities to achieve robust actuation with few active
degrees of freedom. Soft growing robots in particular have shown promise in
navigation of unstructured environments due to their passive deformation. If
their collisions and subsequent deformations can be better understood, soft
robots could be used to understand the structure of the environment from direct
tactile measurements. In this work, we propose the use of soft growing robots
as mapping and exploration tools. We do this by first characterizing collision
behavior during discrete turns, then leveraging this model to develop a
geometry-based simulator that models robot trajectories in 2D environments.
Finally, we demonstrate the model and simulator validity by mapping unknown
environments using Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the optimal next deployment
given current knowledge. Over both uniform and non-uniform environments, this
selection method rapidly approaches ideal actions, showing the potential for
soft growing robots in unstructured environment exploration and mapping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶数据集缺乏安全关键场景，难以有效训练和评估系统安全性，因此需要一种能够生成高真实性高风险场景的方法。

Conclusion: RCG框架能生成更真实和高风险的场景，为自动驾驶系统的压力测试提供更有效的工具。

Abstract: Safety-critical scenarios are essential for training and evaluating
autonomous driving (AD) systems, yet remain extremely rare in real-world
driving datasets. To address this, we propose Real-world Crash Grounding (RCG),
a scenario generation framework that integrates crash-informed semantics into
adversarial perturbation pipelines. We construct a safety-aware behavior
representation through contrastive pre-training on large-scale driving logs,
followed by fine-tuning on a small, crash-rich dataset with approximate
trajectory annotations extracted from video. This embedding captures semantic
structure aligned with real-world accident behaviors and supports selection of
adversary trajectories that are both high-risk and behaviorally realistic. We
incorporate the resulting selection mechanism into two prior scenario
generation pipelines, replacing their handcrafted scoring objectives with an
embedding-based criterion. Experimental results show that ego agents trained
against these generated scenarios achieve consistently higher downstream
success rates, with an average improvement of 9.2% across seven evaluation
settings. Qualitative and quantitative analyses further demonstrate that our
approach produces more plausible and nuanced adversary behaviors, enabling more
effective and realistic stress testing of AD systems. Code and tools will be
released publicly.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的实时交互感知框架 rt-RISeg，通过机器人交互和设计的体帧不变特征（BFIF）来持续分割未见过的物体，解决了传统方法在分布外场景中泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的未见物体实例分割（UOIS）方法依赖于大规模数据集训练，容易过拟合静态视觉特征，导致在分布外场景中泛化能力差。作者认为视觉本质上是交互的和动态的，因此提出了一种基于交互感知的新方法。

Conclusion: 通过实时交互感知和动态特征分析，rt-RISeg 显著提升了未见物体分割的准确性和泛化能力，同时展示了与其他视觉基础模型的兼容性。

Abstract: Successful execution of dexterous robotic manipulation tasks in new
environments, such as grasping, depends on the ability to proficiently segment
unseen objects from the background and other objects. Previous works in unseen
object instance segmentation (UOIS) train models on large-scale datasets, which
often leads to overfitting on static visual features. This dependency results
in poor generalization performance when confronted with out-of-distribution
scenarios. To address this limitation, we rethink the task of UOIS based on the
principle that vision is inherently interactive and occurs over time. We
propose a novel real-time interactive perception framework, rt-RISeg, that
continuously segments unseen objects by robot interactions and analysis of a
designed body frame-invariant feature (BFIF). We demonstrate that the relative
rotational and linear velocities of randomly sampled body frames, resulting
from selected robot interactions, can be used to identify objects without any
learned segmentation model. This fully self-contained segmentation pipeline
generates and updates object segmentation masks throughout each robot
interaction without the need to wait for an action to finish. We showcase the
effectiveness of our proposed interactive perception method by achieving an
average object segmentation accuracy rate 27.5% greater than state-of-the-art
UOIS methods. Furthermore, although rt-RISeg is a standalone framework, we show
that the autonomously generated segmentation masks can be used as prompts to
vision foundation models for significantly improved performance.

Abstract: General-purpose robotic manipulation, including reach and grasp, is essential
for deployment into households and workspaces involving diverse and evolving
tasks. Recent advances propose using large pre-trained models, such as Large
Language Models and object detectors, to boost robotic perception in
reinforcement learning. These models, trained on large datasets via
self-supervised learning, can process text prompts and identify diverse objects
in scenes, an invaluable skill in RL where learning object interaction is
resource-intensive. This study demonstrates how to integrate such models into
Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning to enable general and versatile robotic
reach and grasp capabilities. We use a pre-trained object detection model to
enable the agent to identify the object from a text prompt and generate a mask
for goal conditioning. Mask-based goal conditioning provides object-agnostic
cues, improving feature sharing and generalization. The effectiveness of the
proposed framework is demonstrated in a simulated reach-and-grasp task, where
the mask-based goal conditioning consistently maintains a $\sim$90\% success
rate in grasping both in and out-of-distribution objects, while also ensuring
faster convergence to higher returns.

Conclusion: SMART-Merge 能够高效处理复杂并道任务，为自动驾驶提供可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Merging onto a highway is a complex driving task that requires identifying a
safe gap, adjusting speed, often interactions to create a merging gap, and
completing the merge maneuver within a limited time window while maintaining
safety and driving comfort. In this paper, we introduce a Safe Merging and
Real-Time Merge (SMART-Merge) planner, a lattice-based motion planner designed
to facilitate safe and comfortable forced merging. By deliberately adapting
cost terms to the unique challenges of forced merging and introducing a desired
speed heuristic, SMART-Merge planner enables the ego vehicle to merge
successfully while minimizing the merge time. We verify the efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed merge planner through high-fidelity CarMaker
simulations on hundreds of highway merge scenarios. Our proposed planner
achieves the success rate of 100% as well as completes the merge maneuver in
the shortest amount of time compared with the baselines, demonstrating our
planner's capability to handle complex forced merge tasks and provide a
reliable and robust solution for autonomous highway merge. The simulation

Result: 实验验证了算法在无碰撞运动规划、技能链和混合系统最优控制中的高效性。

Conclusion: GCS中的SWP为机器人混合规划问题提供了统一的解决方案，兼具高性能与计算效率。

Abstract: We study the Shortest-Walk Problem (SWP) in a Graph of Convex Sets (GCS). A
GCS is a graph where each vertex is paired with a convex program, and each edge
couples adjacent programs via additional costs and constraints. A walk in a GCS
is a sequence of vertices connected by edges, where vertices may be repeated.
The length of a walk is given by the cumulative optimal value of the
corresponding convex programs. To solve the SWP in GCS, we first synthesize a
piecewise-quadratic lower bound on the problem's cost-to-go function using
semidefinite programming. Then we use this lower bound to guide an
incremental-search algorithm that yields an approximate shortest walk. We show
that the SWP in GCS is a natural language for many mixed discrete-continuous
planning problems in robotics, unifying problems that typically require
specialized solutions while delivering high performance and computational
efficiency. We demonstrate this through experiments in collision-free motion
planning, skill chaining, and optimal control of hybrid systems.

Abstract: This letter presents a novel coarse-to-fine motion planning framework for
robotic manipulation in cluttered, unmodeled environments. The system
integrates a dual-camera perception setup with a B-spline-based model
predictive control (MPC) scheme. Initially, the planner generates feasible
global trajectories from partial and uncertain observations. As new visual data
are incrementally fused, both the environment model and motion planning are
progressively refined. A vision-based cost function promotes target-driven
exploration, while a refined kernel-perceptron collision detector enables
efficient constraint updates for real-time planning. The framework accommodates
closed-chain kinematics and supports dynamic replanning. Experiments on a
multi-arm platform validate its robustness and adaptability under uncertainties

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了基于模仿学习的移动操纵系统的泛化能力与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Imitation learning for mobile manipulation is a key challenge in the field of
robotic manipulation. However, current mobile manipulation frameworks typically
decouple navigation and manipulation, executing manipulation only after
reaching a certain location. This can lead to performance degradation when
navigation is imprecise, especially due to misalignment in approach angles. To
enable a mobile manipulator to perform the same task from diverse orientations,
an essential capability for building general-purpose robotic models, we propose
an object-centric method based on SAM2, a foundation model towards solving
promptable visual segmentation in images, which incorporates manipulation
orientation information into our model. Our approach enables consistent
understanding of the same task from different orientations. We deploy the model
on a custom-built mobile manipulator and evaluate it on a pick-and-place task
under varied orientation angles. Compared to Action Chunking Transformer, our
model maintains superior generalization when trained with demonstrations from
varied approach angles. This work significantly enhances the generalization and
robustness of imitation learning-based mobile manipulation systems.

mechanism combining current observations with historical states and actions
through a novel diffusion U-Net architecture, significantly improving
long-horizon planning. (2) A sample-efficient hybrid learning architecture that
synergizes diffusion-guided exploration with RL policy optimization, where the
diffusion model generates diverse candidate actions and the RL critic selects
optimal actions, achieving higher exploration efficiency and policy stability
in dynamic underwater environments. Extensive simulation experiments validating
the method's superior robustness and flexibility, outperforms conventional
control methods in challenging marine conditions, offering enhanced

Abstract: We study online algorithms to tune the parameters of a robot controller in a
setting where the dynamics, policy class, and optimality objective are all
time-varying. The system follows a single trajectory without episodes or state
resets, and the time-varying information is not known in advance. Focusing on
nonlinear geometric quadrotor controllers as a test case, we propose a
practical implementation of a single-trajectory model-based online policy
optimization algorithm, M-GAPS,along with reparameterizations of the quadrotor
state space and policy class to improve the optimization landscape. In hardware
experiments,we compare to model-based and model-free baselines that impose
artificial episodes. We show that M-GAPS finds near-optimal parameters more
quickly, especially when the episode length is not favorable. We also show that
M-GAPS rapidly adapts to heavy unmodeled wind and payload disturbances, and
achieves similar strong improvement on a 1:6-scale Ackermann-steered car. Our
results demonstrate the hardware practicality of this emerging class of online
policy optimization that offers significantly more flexibility than classic
adaptive control, while being more stable and data-efficient than model-free
reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: 仿真验证了所提框架的有效性，为MeSCRs的设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified modeling and optimization framework to enhance
the kinematic performance of multi-magnet embedded soft continuum robots
(MeSCRs). To this end, we establish a differentiable system formulation based
on an extended pseudo-rigid-body model. This formulation enables analysis of
the equilibrium well-posedness and the geometry of the induced configuration
under magnetic actuation. In particular, we show that the maximum controllable
degrees of freedom of a MeSCR equal twice the number of embedded magnets. We
subsequently develop a structural optimization framework based on differential
geometry that links classical kinematic measures (e.g., manipulability and
dexterity) to the configuration of embedded magnets. The resulting optimization
condition reveals that improving local performance requires structurally
modulating the spectrum of the configuration space metric to counteract its
distortion. Closed-form solutions for optimal magnet configurations are derived
under representative conditions, and a gradient-based numerical method is
proposed for general design scenarios. Simulation studies validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: This paper presents a state-estimation solution for legged robots that uses a
set of low-cost, compact, and lightweight sensors to achieve low-drift pose and
velocity estimation under challenging locomotion conditions. The key idea is to
leverage multiple inertial measurement units on different links of the robot to
correct a major error source in standard proprioceptive odometry. We fuse the
inertial sensor information and joint encoder measurements in an extended
Kalman filter, then combine the velocity estimate from this filter with camera
data in a factor-graph-based sliding-window estimator to form a
visual-inertial-leg odometry method. We validate our state estimator through
comprehensive theoretical analysis and hardware experiments performed using
real-world robot data collected during a variety of challenging locomotion
tasks. Our algorithm consistently achieves minimal position deviation, even in
scenarios involving substantial ground impact, foot slippage, and sudden body
rotations. A C++ implementation, along with a large-scale dataset, is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人机交互研究多集中于单用户情境，而多用户环境（如商场、医院）中机器人需动态决定响应时机和对象。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用Transformer架构的多任务学习框架，设计两种新损失函数，分别优化场景建模和针对机器人的响应选择，并构建多用户HRI数据集。

Result: 实验表明，模型在响应决策上表现优于现有启发式和单任务方法，达到先进水平。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了社交机器人在多用户互动中的智能化，使其更自然且情境感知。

Abstract: Prior human-robot interaction (HRI) research has primarily focused on
single-user interactions, where robots do not need to consider the timing or
recipient of their responses. However, in multi-party interactions, such as at
malls and hospitals, social robots must understand the context and decide both
when and to whom they should respond. In this paper, we propose a
Transformer-based multi-task learning framework to improve the decision-making
process of social robots, particularly in multi-user environments. Considering
the characteristics of HRI, we propose two novel loss functions: one that
enforces constraints on active speakers to improve scene modeling, and another
that guides response selection towards utterances specifically directed at the
robot. Additionally, we construct a novel multi-party HRI dataset that captures
real-world complexities, such as gaze misalignment. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in respond
decisions, outperforming existing heuristic-based and single-task approaches.
Our findings contribute to the development of socially intelligent social
robots capable of engaging in natural and context-aware multi-party
interactions.

Conclusion: EquiContact框架及其设计原则（顺应性、局部策略和等变性）有效实现了空间泛化的接触丰富任务策略。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for learning vision-based robotic policies
for contact-rich manipulation tasks that generalize spatially across task
configurations. We focus on achieving robust spatial generalization of the
policy for the peg-in-hole (PiH) task trained from a small number of
demonstrations. We propose EquiContact, a hierarchical policy composed of a
high-level vision planner (Diffusion Equivariant Descriptor Field, Diff-EDF)
and a novel low-level compliant visuomotor policy (Geometric Compliant ACT,
G-CompACT). G-CompACT operates using only localized observations (geometrically
consistent error vectors (GCEV), force-torque readings, and wrist-mounted RGB
images) and produces actions defined in the end-effector frame. Through these
design choices, we show that the entire EquiContact pipeline is
SE(3)-equivariant, from perception to force control. We also outline three key
components for spatially generalizable contact-rich policies: compliance,
localized policies, and induced equivariance. Real-world experiments on PiH
tasks demonstrate a near-perfect success rate and robust generalization to
unseen spatial configurations, validating the proposed framework and
principles. The experimental videos can be found on the project website:

Conclusion: 通过改进的Voxblox框架，能够更有效地处理水下视觉传感中的不确定性。

Abstract: Vision-based underwater robots can be useful in inspecting and exploring
confined spaces where traditional sensors and preplanned paths cannot be
followed. Sensor noise and situational change can cause significant uncertainty
in environmental representation. Thus, this paper explores how to represent
mapping inconsistency in vision-based sensing and incorporate depth estimation
confidence into the mapping framework. The scene depth and the confidence are
estimated using the RAFT-Stereo model and are integrated into a voxel-based
mapping framework, Voxblox. Improvements in the existing Voxblox weight
calculation and update mechanism are also proposed. Finally, a qualitative
analysis of the proposed method is performed in a confined pool and in a pier
in the Trondheim fjord. Experiments using an underwater robot demonstrated the
change in uncertainty in the visualization.

Motivation: 从演示中学习时间约束以重现类似逻辑约束行为的需求，但由于组合空间巨大和非马尔可夫约束的复杂性，这一问题具有挑战性。

Result: ILCL在四个时间约束任务中优于现有方法，并成功应用于真实世界任务。

Conclusion: ILCL是一种有效的学习方法，能够高效生成和转移时间约束。

Abstract: We aim to solve the problem of temporal-constraint learning from
demonstrations to reproduce demonstration-like logic-constrained behaviors.
Learning logic constraints is challenging due to the combinatorially large
space of possible specifications and the ill-posed nature of non-Markovian
constraints. To figure it out, we introduce a novel temporal-constraint
learning method, which we call inverse logic-constraint learning (ILCL). Our
method frames ICL as a two-player zero-sum game between 1) a genetic
algorithm-based temporal-logic mining (GA-TL-Mining) and 2) logic-constrained
reinforcement learning (Logic-CRL). GA-TL-Mining efficiently constructs syntax
trees for parameterized truncated linear temporal logic (TLTL) without
predefined templates. Subsequently, Logic-CRL finds a policy that maximizes
task rewards under the constructed TLTL constraints via a novel constraint
redistribution scheme. Our evaluations show ILCL outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in learning and transferring TL constraints on four temporally
constrained tasks. We also demonstrate successful transfer to real-world
peg-in-shallow-hole tasks.

Conclusion: LE-Nav通过自适应超参数调优，显著提升了服务机器人在动态环境中的表现，同时提高了社交接受度。

Abstract: Service robots are increasingly deployed in diverse and dynamic environments,
where both physical layouts and social contexts change over time and across
locations. In these unstructured settings, conventional navigation systems that
rely on fixed parameters often fail to generalize across scenarios, resulting
in degraded performance and reduced social acceptance. Although recent
approaches have leveraged reinforcement learning to enhance traditional
planners, these methods often fail in real-world deployments due to poor
generalization and limited simulation diversity, which hampers effective
sim-to-real transfer. To tackle these issues, we present LE-Nav, an
interpretable and scene-aware navigation framework that leverages multi-modal
large language model reasoning and conditional variational autoencoders to
adaptively tune planner hyperparameters. To achieve zero-shot scene
understanding, we utilize one-shot exemplars and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies. Additionally, a conditional variational autoencoder captures the
mapping between natural language instructions and navigation hyperparameters,
enabling expert-level tuning. Experiments show that LE-Nav can generate
hyperparameters achieving human-level tuning across diverse planners and
scenarios. Real-world navigation trials and a user study on a smart wheelchair
platform demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
quantitative metrics such as success rate, efficiency, safety, and comfort,
while receiving higher subjective scores for perceived safety and social
acceptance. Code is available at https://github.com/Cavendish518/LE-Nav.

Abstract: This study presents an advanced approach to enhance robotic manipulation in
uncertain and challenging environments, with a focus on autonomous operations
augmented by human-in-the-loop (HITL) control for lunar missions. By
integrating human decision-making with autonomous robotic functions, the
research improves task reliability and efficiency for space applications. The
key task addressed is the autonomous deployment of flexible solar panels using
an extendable ladder-like structure and a robotic manipulator with real-time
feedback for precision. The manipulator relays position and force-torque data,
enabling dynamic error detection and adaptive control during deployment. To
mitigate the effects of sinkage, variable payload, and low-lighting conditions,
efficient motion planning strategies are employed, supplemented by human
control that allows operators to intervene in ambiguous scenarios. Digital twin
simulation enhances system robustness by enabling continuous feedback,
iterative task refinement, and seamless integration with the deployment

Conclusion: TRAN-D在透明物体重建中表现优异，尤其适用于动态环境和稀疏视图场景，未来可能进一步推广应用。

Abstract: Understanding the 3D geometry of transparent objects from RGB images is
challenging due to their inherent physical properties, such as reflection and
refraction. To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse
views and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian
Splatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key
insight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling
focused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate
artifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions,
ensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting.
Furthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the
reconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and
chain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning.
TRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it
consistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based
state-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean
absolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore,
despite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\delta} < 2.5 cm
accuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.

TL;DR: 本文提出了刚性体系统运动方程（EOM）的二阶时间导数闭式表达式，替代现有递归算法，为机器人控制提供了更直观的导数结构分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人控制中，特别是包含弹性部件的多体系统，不仅需要平滑轨迹，还需要控制力/力矩的时间导数。因此，需要高效计算EOM的时间导数。

Method: 利用李群理论，推导出EOM的二阶时间导数闭式表达式，避免了递归算法的复杂性，且方程形式紧凑易参数化。

Result: 提出的方法生成了EOM的二阶时间导数闭式表达式，为机器人控制和设计提供了直接且高效的工具。

Conclusion: 这一方法不仅简化了EOM导数的计算，还为机器人系统的动态分析和控制提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Derivatives of equations of motion(EOM) describing the dynamics of rigid body
systems are becoming increasingly relevant for the robotics community and find
many applications in design and control of robotic systems. Controlling robots,
and multibody systems comprising elastic components in particular, not only
requires smooth trajectories but also the time derivatives of the control
forces/torques, hence of the EOM. This paper presents the time derivatives of
the EOM in closed form up to second-order as an alternative formulation to the
existing recursive algorithms for this purpose, which provides a direct insight
into the structure of the derivatives. The Lie group formulation for rigid body
systems is used giving rise to very compact and easily parameterized equations.

Motivation: 诊断活动（如超声检查和触诊）虽然成本低，但易出错且依赖高技能医疗人员，机器人方案可减少结果的主观性和等待时间。

Method: 通过机器人系统测量多种材料（包括离体组织）的黏弹性参数，并与高精度仪器表征的硅胶标本数据进行对比。

Result: 实验结果显示机器人系统的准确性与基准数据高度匹配，支持其在临床中的潜在应用。

Conclusion: 机器人系统在估计生物组织黏弹性参数方面具有高精度，为未来临床诊断应用提供了信心。

Abstract: Diagnostic activities, such as ultrasound scans and palpation, are relatively
low-cost. They play a crucial role in the early detection of health problems
and in assessing their progression. However, they are also error-prone
activities, which require highly skilled medical staff. The use of robotic
solutions can be key to decreasing the inherent subjectivity of the results and
reducing the waiting list. For a robot to perform palpation or ultrasound
scans, it must effectively manage physical interactions with the human body,
which greatly benefits from precise estimation of the patient's tissue
biomechanical properties. This paper assesses the accuracy and precision of a
robotic system in estimating the viscoelastic parameters of various materials,
including some tests on ex vivo tissues as a preliminary proof-of-concept
demonstration of the method's applicability to biological samples. The
measurements are compared against a ground truth derived from silicone
specimens with different viscoelastic properties, characterised using a
high-precision instrument. Experimental results show that the robotic system's
accuracy closely matches the ground truth, increasing confidence in the
potential use of robots for such clinical applications.

Conclusion: 提出的策略在无先验边界条件下实现了高精度的轨迹跟踪。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based robust feedback
linearization strategy to ensure precise trajectory tracking for an important
family of Lagrangian systems. We assume a nominal knowledge of the dynamics is
given but no a-priori bounds on the model mismatch are available. In our
approach, the key ingredient is the adoption of a regression framework based on
Gaussian Processes (GPR) to estimate the model mismatch. This estimate is added
to the outer loop of a classical feedback linearization scheme based on the
nominal knowledge available. Then, to compensate for the residual uncertainty,
we robustify the controller including an additional term whose size is designed
based on the variance provided by the GPR framework. We proved that, with high
probability, the proposed scheme is able to guarantee asymptotic tracking of a
desired trajectory. We tested numerically our strategy on a 2 degrees of
freedom planar robot.

Abstract: Physically reduced-scale vehicles are emerging to accelerate the development
of advanced automated driving functions. In this paper, we investigate the
effects of scaling on self-localization accuracy with visual and
visual-inertial algorithms using cameras and an inertial measurement unit
(IMU). For this purpose, ROS2-compatible visual and visual-inertial algorithms
are selected, and datasets are chosen as a baseline for real-sized vehicles. A
test drive is conducted to record data of reduced-scale vehicles. We compare
the selected localization algorithms, OpenVINS, VINS-Fusion, and RTAB-Map, in
terms of their pose accuracy against the ground-truth and against data from
real-sized vehicles. When comparing the implementation of the selected
localization algorithms to real-sized vehicles, OpenVINS has the lowest average
localization error. Although all selected localization algorithms have
overlapping error ranges, OpenVINS also performs best when applied to a
reduced-scale vehicle. When reduced-scale vehicles were compared to real-sized
vehicles, minor differences were found in translational vehicle motion
estimation accuracy. However, no significant differences were found when
comparing the estimation accuracy of rotational vehicle motion, allowing RSVRs
to be used as testing platforms for self-localization algorithms.

Motivation: COVID-19疫情期间，医疗资源短缺，亟需自动化消毒以控制病毒传播并保障医护人员和患者安全。传统紫外线消毒研究忽视了人类活动对病毒分布的影响。

Method: 开发了一种移动机器人系统，优先消毒高风险区域，并通过优化紫外线剂量确保所有表面获得足够的紫外线照射。

Result: 在两个典型医院场景中，该方法在保持相同消毒效果的同时，将消毒时间分别减少了30.7%和31.9%。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected public health, healthcare
systems, and daily life, especially amid resource shortages and limited
workers. This crisis has underscored the urgent need for automation in hospital
environments, particularly disinfection, which is crucial to controlling virus
transmission and improving the safety of healthcare personnel and patients.
Ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection, known for its high efficiency, has been
widely adopted in hospital settings. However, most existing research focuses on
maximizing UV coverage while paying little attention to the impact of human
activity on virus distribution. To address this issue, we propose a mobile
robotic system for UV disinfection focusing on the virus hotspot. The system
prioritizes disinfection in high-risk areas and employs an approach for
optimized UV dosage to ensure that all surfaces receive an adequate level of UV
exposure while significantly reducing disinfection time. It not only improves
disinfection efficiency but also minimizes unnecessary exposure in low-risk
areas. In two representative hospital scenarios, our method achieves the same
disinfection effectiveness while reducing disinfection time by 30.7% and 31.9%,
respectively. The video of the experiment is available at:

Motivation: 双臂操作在机器人领域具有重要价值，但高维动作空间和复杂协调需求带来了巨大挑战。利用视频预测能力来增强双臂协调的研究尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用扩散模型联合优化视频和动作预测，提出多帧潜在预测策略和单向注意力机制，以压缩潜在空间表示未来状态。在推理阶段省略视频预测以提高效率。

Result: 在模拟和真实环境下均显著提升了任务成功率，ALOHA上提升24.9%，RoboTwin上提升11.1%，真实实验中提升32.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了双臂协调的表现，验证了扩散模型在机器人任务中的潜力，模型和代码已开源。

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation is crucial in robotics, enabling complex tasks in
industrial automation and household services. However, it poses significant
challenges due to the high-dimensional action space and intricate coordination
requirements. While video prediction has been recently studied for
representation learning and control, leveraging its ability to capture rich
dynamic and behavioral information, its potential for enhancing bimanual
coordination remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified
diffusion-based framework for the joint optimization of video and action
prediction. Specifically, we propose a multi-frame latent prediction strategy
that encodes future states in a compressed latent space, preserving
task-relevant features. Furthermore, we introduce a unidirectional attention
mechanism where video prediction is conditioned on the action, while action
prediction remains independent of video prediction. This design allows us to
omit video prediction during inference, significantly enhancing efficiency.
Experiments on two simulated benchmarks and a real-world setting demonstrate a
significant improvement in the success rate over the strong baseline ACT using
our method, achieving a \textbf{24.9\%} increase on ALOHA, an \textbf{11.1\%}
increase on RoboTwin, and a \textbf{32.5\%} increase in real-world experiments.

Motivation: 许多飞行生物依赖视觉进行姿态控制，而传统飞行机器人通常依赖惯性传感器。本研究探索了仅通过视觉实现飞行控制的可能性，以模仿自然界的飞行机制。

Method: 使用向下事件相机和递归卷积神经网络，通过监督学习训练，直接从事件流中提取姿态和旋转速率信息。

Result: 实验表明，事件相机和低延迟神经网络能够替代传统惯性测量单元，且在泛化性和视野范围测试中表现良好。

Conclusion: 本研究证明视觉控制的潜力，为昆虫级飞行机器人的自主飞行提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision is an essential part of attitude control for many flying animals, some
of which have no dedicated sense of gravity. Flying robots, on the other hand,
typically depend heavily on accelerometers and gyroscopes for attitude
stabilization. In this work, we present the first vision-only approach to
flight control for use in generic environments. We show that a quadrotor drone
equipped with a downward-facing event camera can estimate its attitude and
rotation rate from just the event stream, enabling flight control without
inertial sensors. Our approach uses a small recurrent convolutional neural
network trained through supervised learning. Real-world flight tests
demonstrate that our combination of event camera and low-latency neural network
is capable of replacing the inertial measurement unit in a traditional flight
control loop. Furthermore, we investigate the network's generalization across
different environments, and the impact of memory and different fields of view.
While networks with memory and access to horizon-like visual cues achieve best
performance, variants with a narrower field of view achieve better relative
generalization. Our work showcases vision-only flight control as a promising
candidate for enabling autonomous, insect-scale flying robots.

Abstract: The RoboCup Logistics League is a RoboCup competition in a smart factory
scenario that has focused on task planning, job scheduling, and multi-agent
coordination. The focus on production logistics allowed teams to develop highly
competitive strategies, but also meant that some recent developments in the
context of smart manufacturing are not reflected in the competition, weakening
its relevance over the years. In this paper, we describe the vision for the
RoboCup Smart Manufacturing League, a new competition designed as a larger
smart manufacturing scenario, reflecting all the major aspects of a modern
factory. It will consist of several tracks that are initially independent but
gradually combined into one smart manufacturing scenario. The new tracks will
cover industrial robotics challenges such as assembly, human-robot
collaboration, and humanoid robotics, but also retain a focus on production
logistics. We expect the reenvisioned competition to be more attractive to
newcomers and well-tried teams, while also shifting the focus to current and
future challenges of industrial robotics.

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration in surgery represents a significant area of
research, driven by the increasing capability of autonomous robotic systems to
assist surgeons in complex procedures. This systematic review examines the
advancements and persistent challenges in the development of autonomous
surgical robotic assistants (ASARs), focusing specifically on scenarios where
robots provide meaningful and active support to human surgeons. Adhering to the
PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted across the
IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, resulting in the selection
of 32 studies for detailed analysis. Two primary collaborative setups were
identified: teleoperation-based assistance and direct hands-on interaction. The
findings reveal a growing research emphasis on ASARs, with predominant
applications currently in endoscope guidance, alongside emerging progress in
autonomous tool manipulation. Several key challenges hinder wider adoption,
including the alignment of robotic actions with human surgeon preferences, the
necessity for procedural awareness within autonomous systems, the establishment
of seamless human-robot information exchange, and the complexities of skill
acquisition in shared workspaces. This review synthesizes current trends,
identifies critical limitations, and outlines future research directions
essential to improve the reliability, safety, and effectiveness of human-robot
collaboration in surgical environments.

Conclusion: 该框架在动态环境中展现出鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: We propose a multi-robot control paradigm to solve point-to-point navigation
tasks for a team of holonomic robots with access to the full environment
information. The framework invokes two processes asynchronously at high
frequency: (i) a centralized, discrete, and full-horizon planner for computing
collision- and deadlock-free paths rapidly, leveraging recent advances in
multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and (ii) dynamics-aware, robot-wise optimal
trajectory controllers that ensure all robots independently follow their
assigned paths reliably. This hierarchical shift in planning representation
from (i) discrete and coupled to (ii) continuous and decoupled domains enables
the framework to maintain long-term scalable motion synthesis. As an
instantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast
state-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack
(Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and
versatile mechanism for lifelong multi-robot navigation even under asynchronous
and partial goal updates, and adapts to dynamic workspaces simply by quick
replanning. We present various multirotor and ground robot demonstrations,
including the deployment of 15 real multirotors with random, consecutive target
updates while a person walks through the operational workspace.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have seen remarkable advances in dexterity, balance, and
locomotion, yet their role in expressive domains, such as music performance,
remains largely unexplored. Musical tasks, like drumming, present unique
challenges, including split-second timing, rapid contacts, and multi-limb
coordination over pieces lasting minutes. In this paper, we introduce Robot
Drummer, a humanoid system capable of expressive, high-precision drumming
across a diverse repertoire of songs. We formulate humanoid drumming as
sequential fulfillment of timed-contacts and transform drum scores in to a
Rhythmic Contact Chain. To handle the long-horizon nature of musical
performance, we decompose each piece into fixed-length segments and train a
single policy across all segments in parallel using reinforcement learning.
Through extensive experiments on over thirty popular rock, metal, and jazz
tracks, our results demonstrate that Robot Drummer consistently achieves high
F1 scores. The learned behaviors exhibit emergent human-like drumming
strategies, such as cross-arm strikes, and adaptive sticks assignments,
demonstrating the potential of reinforcement learning to bring humanoid robots
into the domain of creative musical performance. Project page:

Abstract: Ambiguity in natural language instructions poses significant risks in
safety-critical human-robot interaction, particularly in domains such as
surgery. To address this, we propose a framework that uses Large Language
Models (LLMs) for ambiguity detection specifically designed for collaborative
surgical scenarios. Our method employs an ensemble of LLM evaluators, each
configured with distinct prompting techniques to identify linguistic,
contextual, procedural, and critical ambiguities. A chain-of-thought evaluator
is included to systematically analyze instruction structure for potential
issues. Individual evaluator assessments are synthesized through conformal
prediction, which yields non-conformity scores based on comparison to a labeled
calibration dataset. Evaluating Llama 3.2 11B and Gemma 3 12B, we observed
classification accuracy exceeding 60% in differentiating ambiguous from
unambiguous surgical instructions. Our approach improves the safety and
reliability of human-robot collaboration in surgery by offering a mechanism to
identify potentially ambiguous instructions before robot action.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种退休资金管理策略，通过两步规划在不确定环境下实现稳定的通胀调整消费目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决退休者在面对税收、通胀和投资不确定性时如何管理储蓄以维持恒定消费水平的问题。

Method: 采用两步法：首先构建一个简化凸优化模型，最大化遗产并满足消费目标；然后利用模型预测控制（MPC）每年更新计划以应对不确定性。

Result: 通过蒙特卡洛模拟验证了MPC策略在应对投资回报、通胀和税收变化时的有效性。

Conclusion: MPC退休资金策略能灵活应对不确定性，实现长期稳定的消费目标。

Abstract: The retirement funding problem addresses the question of how to manage a
retiree's savings to provide her with a constant post-tax inflation adjusted
consumption throughout her lifetime. This consists of choosing withdrawals and
transfers from and between several accounts with different tax treatments,
taking into account basic rules such as required minimum distributions and
limits on Roth conversions, additional income, liabilities, taxes, and the
bequest when the retiree dies. We develop a retirement funding policy in two
steps. In the first step, we consider a simplified planning problem in which
various future quantities, such as the retiree's remaining lifetime, future
investment returns, and future inflation, are known. Using a simplified model
of taxes, we pose this planning problem as a convex optimization problem, where
we maximize the bequest subject to providing a constant inflation adjusted
consumption target. Since this problem is convex, it can be solved quickly and
reliably. We leverage this planning method to form a retirement funding policy
that determines the actions to take each year, based on information known at
that time. Each year the retiree forms a new plan for the future years, using
the current account values and life expectancy, and optionally, updated
information such as changes in tax rates or rules. The retiree then carries out
the actions from the first year of the current plan. This update-plan-act cycle
is repeated each year, a general policy called model predictive control (MPC).
The MPC retirement policy reacts to the effects of uncertain investment returns
and inflation, changes in the retiree's expected lifetime or external income
and liabilities, and changes in tax rules and rates. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the MPC retirement policy using Monte Carlo simulation.

Abstract: This paper studies the optimal investment behavior of renewable electricity

characterized via a coupled system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker-Planck
equations, which describe the value function of a representative producer and
the evolution of the distribution of installed capacities over time. We analyze
both deterministic and stochastic versions of the model, providing analytical
insights in tractable cases and developing numerical methods to approximate the
general solution. Simulation results illustrate how aggregate investment
responds to changing market conditions, cost structures, and exogenous
productivity shocks.

ambiguity? Attempts to extend Scarf's celebrated distribution-free ordering
rule using risk measures have led to conflicting prescriptions: CVaR-based
models invariably recommend ordering less as risk aversion increases, while
mean-standard deviation models -- paradoxically -- suggest ordering more,
particularly when ordering costs are high. We resolve this behavioral paradox
through a coherent generalization of Scarf's distribution-free framework,
modeling risk aversion via distortion functionals from dual utility theory.
Despite the generality of this class, we derive closed-form optimal ordering
rules for any coherent risk preference. These rules uncover a consistent
behavioral principle: a more risk-averse newsvendor may rationally order more
when overstocking is inexpensive (i.e., when the cost-to-price ratio is low),
but will always order less when ordering is costly. Our framework offers a more
nuanced, managerially intuitive, and behaviorally coherent understanding of
risk-averse inventory decisions. It exposes the limitations of non-coherent
models, delivers interpretable and easy-to-compute ordering rules grounded in
coherent preferences, and unifies prior work under a single, tractable
approach. We further extend the results to multi-product settings with
arbitrary demand dependencies, showing that optimal order quantities remain
separable and can be obtained by solving single-product problems independently.

Abstract: In this paper, we address stochastic optimization problems involving a
composition of a non-smooth outer function and a smooth inner function, a
formulation frequently encountered in machine learning and operations research.
To deal with the non-differentiability of the outer function, we approximate
the original non-smooth function using smoothing functions, which are
continuously differentiable and approach the original function as a smoothing
parameter goes to zero (at the price of increasingly higher Lipschitz
constants). The proposed smoothing stochastic gradient method iteratively
drives the smoothing parameter to zero at a designated rate. We establish
convergence guarantees under strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex settings,
proving convergence rates that match known results for non-smooth stochastic
compositional optimization. In particular, for convex objectives, smoothing
stochastic gradient achieves a 1/T^(1/4) rate in terms of the number of
stochastic gradient evaluations. We further show how general compositional and
finite-sum compositional problems (widely used frameworks in large-scale
machine learning and risk-averse optimization) fit the assumptions needed for
the rates (unbiased gradient estimates, bounded second moments, and accurate
smoothing errors). We present preliminary numerical results indicating that
smoothing stochastic gradient descent can be competitive for certain classes of
problems.

Abstract: Tilt stability is a fundamental concept of variational analysis and
optimization that plays a pivotal role in both theoretical issues and numerical
computations. This paper investigates tilt stability of local minimizers for a
general class of composite optimization problems in finite dimensions, where
extended-real-valued objectives are compositions of parabolically regular and
smooth functions. Under the weakest metric subregularity constraint
qualification and other verifiable conditions, we establish unified
neighborhood and pointbased characterizations of tilt stability via
second-order generalized differentiation. The obtained results provide a
rigorous theoretical foundation for further developments on variational
stability and numerical algorithms of optimization and related topics.

Result: 表明WCS可用于识别名义成本的脆弱性，并指导选择不确定性集的大小和类型。

Conclusion: 多目标视角为DRO提供了鲁棒性的量化指标和敏感性分析方法，解决了选择不确定性集的关键问题。

Abstract: Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) is a worst-case approach to
decision making when there is model uncertainty. Though formulated as a
single-objective problem, we show that it is intrinsically multi-objective in
that DRO solutions map out a near-Pareto-optimal frontier between expected cost
and a measure of robustness called worst-case sensitivity (WCS). We take this
as the starting point and explore robust decision making through a
multi-objective lens. We show that WCS is a measure of spread and derive WCS
for a collection of uncertainty sets commonly used in DRO. These sensitivity
measures identify the errors against which the nominal expected cost is most
vulnerable and the uncertainty set for the worst-case problem that most
effectively mitigates it. The associated mean-sensitivity frontier is used to
select its size. The multi-objective perspective provides a quantitative
measure of robustness and a sensitivity-based approach to addressing important
conceptual gaps in DRO -- how to choose the family and size of uncertainty sets
for a given cost distribution, and how this affects the solution.

Conclusion: 本研究成功地将DEQ扩展到泊松逆问题，通过改进的几何框架和训练策略，提供了一种高效且稳健的神经正则化方法。

Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are implicit neural networks with fixed
points, which have recently gained attention for learning image regularization
functionals, particularly in settings involving Gaussian fidelities, where
assumptions on the forward operator ensure contractiveness of standard
(proximal) Gradient Descent operators. In this work, we extend the application
of DEQs to Poisson inverse problems, where the data fidelity term is more
appropriately modeled by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. To this end, we
introduce a novel DEQ formulation based on Mirror Descent defined in terms of a
tailored non-Euclidean geometry that naturally adapts with the structure of the
data term. This enables the learning of neural regularizers within a principled
training framework. We derive sufficient conditions to guarantee the
convergence of the learned reconstruction scheme and propose computational
strategies that enable both efficient training and fully parameter-free
inference. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms traditional
model-based approaches and it is comparable to the performance of Bregman
Plug-and-Play methods, while mitigating their typical drawbacks - namely,
sensitivity to initialization and careful tuning of hyperparameters. The code
is publicly available at https://github.com/christiandaniele/DEQ-MD.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种统一优化模型VCR-PESP，用于联合解决周期性列车时刻表问题(TTP)、列车路径和车辆循环问题(VCP)，通过SMT方法显著减少离散化误差和车辆需求，优于传统SAT和MIP模型。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的列车规划阶段（时刻表、路径、车辆循环）通常是分开处理的，其相互依赖性导致车辆使用效率低下，因此需要一种集成优化方法以提高效率和资源利用率。

Conclusion: SMT方法通过集成规划层和放松离散化约束，为铁路规划提供了更高效和可实施的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for jointly solving the periodic Train
Timetabling Problem (TTP), train routing, and Vehicle Circulation Problem (VCP)
through a unified optimization model. While these planning stages are
traditionally addressed sequentially, their interdependencies often lead to
suboptimal vehicle usage. We propose the VCR-PESP, an integrated formulation
that minimizes fleet size while ensuring feasible and infrastructure-compliant
periodic timetables. We present the first Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT)-based method for the VCR-PESP to solve the resulting large-scale
instances. Unlike the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT), which requires time
discretisation, SMT supports continuous time via difference constraints,
eliminating the trade-off between temporal precision and encoding size. Our
approach avoids rounding artifacts and scales effectively, outperforming both
SAT and Mixed Integer Program (MIP) models across non-trivial instances. Using
real-world data from the Swiss narrow-gauge operator RhB, we conduct extensive
experiments to assess the impact of time discretisation, vehicle circulation
strategies, route flexibility, and planning integration. We show that discrete
models inflate vehicle requirements and that fully integrated solutions
substantially reduce fleet needs compared to sequential approaches. Our
framework consistently delivers high-resolution solutions with tractable
runtimes, even in large and complex networks. By combining modeling accuracy
with scalable solver technology, this work establishes SMT as a powerful tool
for integrated railway planning. It demonstrates how relaxing discretisation
and solving across planning layers enables more efficient and implementable
timetables.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决有噪声环境下的优化问题，特别是在边界约束和不精确梯度条件下，提高算法在实际应用中的鲁棒性和效率。

Method: 多层方法（利用问题层次描述）和域分解方法（标准加性Schwarz分解），均为无约束优化中AdaGrad算法的推广。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在理论框架下统一且高效，适用于包括PDE和深度学习在内的广泛问题。

Abstract: Two OFFO (Objective-Function Free Optimization) noise tolerant algorithms are
presented that handle bound constraints, inexact gradients and use second-order
information when available.The first is a multi-level method exploiting a
hierarchical description of the problem and the second is a
domain-decomposition method covering the standard addditive Schwarz
decompositions. Both are generalizations of the first-order AdaGrad algorithm
for unconstrained optimization. Because these algorithms share a common
theoretical framework, a single convergence/complexity theory is provided which
covers them both. Its main result is that, with high probability, both methods
need at most $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and noisy gradient evaluations to
compute an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order critical point of the
bound-constrained problem. Extensive numerical experiments are discussed on
applications ranging from PDE-based problems to deep neural network training,
illustrating their remarkable computational efficiency.
