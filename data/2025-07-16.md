### [1] [A Tax-Efficient Model Predictive Control Policy for Retirement Funding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10603)
*Kasper Johansson,Stephen Boyd*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文研究如何通过优化和管理退休储蓄账户，实现退休后稳定的通胀调整消费，采用模型预测控制（MPC）方法动态调整策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决退休储蓄管理问题，确保退休者在生命周期内获得稳定的税后通胀调整消费。

Method: 分为两步：1）简化未来变量（如寿命、投资回报、通胀）为已知问题，构建凸优化模型；2）基于MPC方法每年更新计划并执行。

Result: 通过蒙特卡洛模拟验证了MPC退休策略的有效性。

Conclusion: MPC方法能灵活应对投资回报、通胀、寿命等不确定性，优化退休资金管理。

Abstract: The retirement funding problem addresses the question of how to manage a
retiree's savings to provide her with a constant post-tax inflation adjusted
consumption throughout her lifetime. This consists of choosing withdrawals and
transfers from and between several accounts with different tax treatments,
taking into account basic rules such as required minimum distributions and
limits on Roth conversions, additional income, liabilities, taxes, and the
bequest when the retiree dies. We develop a retirement funding policy in two
steps. In the first step, we consider a simplified planning problem in which
various future quantities, such as the retiree's remaining lifetime, future
investment returns, and future inflation, are known. Using a simplified model
of taxes, we pose this planning problem as a convex optimization problem, where
we maximize the bequest subject to providing a constant inflation adjusted
consumption target. Since this problem is convex, it can be solved quickly and
reliably. We leverage this planning method to form a retirement funding policy
that determines the actions to take each year, based on information known at
that time. Each year the retiree forms a new plan for the future years, using
the current account values and life expectancy, and optionally, updated
information such as changes in tax rates or rules. The retiree then carries out
the actions from the first year of the current plan. This update-plan-act cycle
is repeated each year, a general policy called model predictive control (MPC).
The MPC retirement policy reacts to the effects of uncertain investment returns
and inflation, changes in the retiree's expected lifetime or external income
and liabilities, and changes in tax rules and rates. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the MPC retirement policy using Monte Carlo simulation.

*Emma Hubert,Dimitrios Lolas,Ronnie Sircar*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了可再生能源生产商在竞争市场中的最优投资行为，考虑了价格和安装成本受行业整体活动影响的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解在存在拥挤效应的市场中，生产商如何战略性地调整投资行为，以及这些行为如何影响市场动态。

Method: 采用了均值场博弈框架，通过耦合的Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman和Fokker-Planck方程描述均衡动态。

Result: 分析了确定性和随机性模型，提供了数值模拟结果，展示了投资如何响应市场变化和外部冲击。

Conclusion: 研究表明，拥挤效应对投资行为和市场动态有显著影响，为政策制定和行业分析提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This paper studies the optimal investment behavior of renewable electricity
producers in a competitive market, where both prices and installation costs are
influenced by aggregate industry activity. We model the resulting crowding
effects using a mean field game framework, capturing the strategic interactions
among a continuum of heterogeneous producers. The equilibrium dynamics are
characterized via a coupled system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker-Planck
equations, which describe the value function of a representative producer and
the evolution of the distribution of installed capacities over time. We analyze
both deterministic and stochastic versions of the model, providing analytical
insights in tractable cases and developing numerical methods to approximate the
general solution. Simulation results illustrate how aggregate investment
responds to changing market conditions, cost structures, and exogenous
productivity shocks.

### [3] [Reconciling Risk-Aversion Paradoxes in the Distribution-Free Newsvendor Problem: Scarf's Rule Meets Dual Utility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10735)
*Jonathan Yu-Meng Li,Tiantian Mao,Reza Valimoradi*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于失真泛函的分布自由框架，解决了风险厌恶新闻报童模型中的行为悖论，并推导出闭式最优订购规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在分布模糊情况下，风险厌恶的新闻报童如何优化订购决策，以解决现有基于CVaR和均值-标准差模型的矛盾结果。

Method: 利用双效用理论中的失真泛函建模风险厌恶，提出了一个分布自由的框架，并推导出闭式最优订购规则。

Result: 发现更风险厌恶的新闻报童在库存成本低时会订购更多，而在订购成本高时总是订购更少，并扩展到多产品场景。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了更直观和一致的风险厌恶库存决策理解，并统一了之前的研究。

Abstract: How should a risk-averse newsvendor order optimally under distributional
ambiguity? Attempts to extend Scarf's celebrated distribution-free ordering
rule using risk measures have led to conflicting prescriptions: CVaR-based
models invariably recommend ordering less as risk aversion increases, while
mean-standard deviation models -- paradoxically -- suggest ordering more,
particularly when ordering costs are high. We resolve this behavioral paradox
through a coherent generalization of Scarf's distribution-free framework,
modeling risk aversion via distortion functionals from dual utility theory.
Despite the generality of this class, we derive closed-form optimal ordering
rules for any coherent risk preference. These rules uncover a consistent
behavioral principle: a more risk-averse newsvendor may rationally order more
when overstocking is inexpensive (i.e., when the cost-to-price ratio is low),
but will always order less when ordering is costly. Our framework offers a more
nuanced, managerially intuitive, and behaviorally coherent understanding of
risk-averse inventory decisions. It exposes the limitations of non-coherent
models, delivers interpretable and easy-to-compute ordering rules grounded in
coherent preferences, and unifies prior work under a single, tractable
approach. We further extend the results to multi-product settings with
arbitrary demand dependencies, showing that optimal order quantities remain
separable and can be obtained by solving single-product problems independently.

Conclusion: 平滑随机梯度方法在特定类别的问题中具有竞争力，适用于大规模机器学习和风险规避优化问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we address stochastic optimization problems involving a
composition of a non-smooth outer function and a smooth inner function, a
formulation frequently encountered in machine learning and operations research.
To deal with the non-differentiability of the outer function, we approximate
the original non-smooth function using smoothing functions, which are
continuously differentiable and approach the original function as a smoothing
parameter goes to zero (at the price of increasingly higher Lipschitz
constants). The proposed smoothing stochastic gradient method iteratively
drives the smoothing parameter to zero at a designated rate. We establish
convergence guarantees under strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex settings,
proving convergence rates that match known results for non-smooth stochastic
compositional optimization. In particular, for convex objectives, smoothing
stochastic gradient achieves a 1/T^(1/4) rate in terms of the number of
stochastic gradient evaluations. We further show how general compositional and
finite-sum compositional problems (widely used frameworks in large-scale
machine learning and risk-averse optimization) fit the assumptions needed for
the rates (unbiased gradient estimates, bounded second moments, and accurate
smoothing errors). We present preliminary numerical results indicating that
smoothing stochastic gradient descent can be competitive for certain classes of
problems.

analyze the properties of the control-to-state operator. We prove the existence
of at least one optimal control and derive both first-order and second-order

assumptions, we also demonstrate that global uniqueness of the optimal control
can be achieved.

demonstrates the effectiveness of our exact method, showing clear advantages
over existing heuristic techniques in terms of accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Tilt stability is a fundamental concept of variational analysis and
optimization that plays a pivotal role in both theoretical issues and numerical
computations. This paper investigates tilt stability of local minimizers for a
general class of composite optimization problems in finite dimensions, where
extended-real-valued objectives are compositions of parabolically regular and
smooth functions. Under the weakest metric subregularity constraint
qualification and other verifiable conditions, we establish unified
neighborhood and pointbased characterizations of tilt stability via
second-order generalized differentiation. The obtained results provide a
rigorous theoretical foundation for further developments on variational
stability and numerical algorithms of optimization and related topics.

### [9] [Distributionally Robust Optimization is a Multi-Objective Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11350)
*Jun-ya Gotoh,Michael Jong Kim,Andrew E. B. Lim*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文展示了分布鲁棒优化（DRO）本质上是多目标的，通过提出一种称为最坏情况敏感性（WCS）的鲁棒性度量，探索了鲁棒决策的多目标视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究DRO在多目标视角下的表现，以填补选择不确定性集合家族和大小的概念空白。

Method: 将DRO视为多目标问题，推导WCS作为分布离散度的度量，并分析常见不确定性集合的WCS。

Result: 研究发现WCS能识别名义期望成本最脆弱的误差，并有效选择不确定性集合以缓解问题。

Conclusion: 多目标视角为DRO提供了鲁棒性的量化度量和敏感性分析方法。

Abstract: Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) is a worst-case approach to
decision making when there is model uncertainty. Though formulated as a
single-objective problem, we show that it is intrinsically multi-objective in
that DRO solutions map out a near-Pareto-optimal frontier between expected cost
and a measure of robustness called worst-case sensitivity (WCS). We take this
as the starting point and explore robust decision making through a
multi-objective lens. We show that WCS is a measure of spread and derive WCS
for a collection of uncertainty sets commonly used in DRO. These sensitivity
measures identify the errors against which the nominal expected cost is most
vulnerable and the uncertainty set for the worst-case problem that most
effectively mitigates it. The associated mean-sensitivity frontier is used to
select its size. The multi-objective perspective provides a quantitative
measure of robustness and a sensitivity-based approach to addressing important
conceptual gaps in DRO -- how to choose the family and size of uncertainty sets
for a given cost distribution, and how this affects the solution.

### [10] [Deep Equilibrium models for Poisson Imaging Inverse problems via Mirror Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11461)
*Christian Daniele,Silvia Villa,Samuel Vaiter,Luca Calatroni*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Mirror Descent的新型DEQ框架，用于解决Poisson逆问题，通过非欧几何结构学习神经正则化器，其性能优于传统方法并与Bregman Plug-and-Play方法相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对Poisson逆问题中数据保真项更适合用Kullback-Leibler散度建模的需求，扩展了DEQ的应用。

Method: 引入基于Mirror Descent的DEQ新框架，利用非欧几何适应数据项结构，保证收敛性并提供高效训练和推理策略。

Result: 数值实验显示该方法优于传统模型方法，性能与Bregman Plug-and-Play方法相当，且避免了对初始化和超参数调优的敏感性。

Conclusion: 该方法为Poisson逆问题提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are implicit neural networks with fixed
points, which have recently gained attention for learning image regularization
functionals, particularly in settings involving Gaussian fidelities, where
assumptions on the forward operator ensure contractiveness of standard
(proximal) Gradient Descent operators. In this work, we extend the application
of DEQs to Poisson inverse problems, where the data fidelity term is more
appropriately modeled by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. To this end, we
introduce a novel DEQ formulation based on Mirror Descent defined in terms of a
tailored non-Euclidean geometry that naturally adapts with the structure of the
data term. This enables the learning of neural regularizers within a principled
training framework. We derive sufficient conditions to guarantee the
convergence of the learned reconstruction scheme and propose computational
strategies that enable both efficient training and fully parameter-free
inference. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms traditional
model-based approaches and it is comparable to the performance of Bregman
Plug-and-Play methods, while mitigating their typical drawbacks - namely,
sensitivity to initialization and careful tuning of hyperparameters. The code
is publicly available at https://github.com/christiandaniele/DEQ-MD.

### [11] [Solving Integrated Periodic Railway Timetabling with Satisfiability Modulo Theories: A Scalable Approach to Routing and Vehicle Circulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11489)
*Florian Fuchs,Bernardo Martin-Iradi,Francesco Corman*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种联合解决周期性列车时刻表问题、列车路径规划和车辆循环问题的统一优化模型，通过SMT方法实现高效求解，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法分阶段处理这些问题，导致车辆使用效率低下。本文旨在通过集成模型优化车辆使用。

Method: 提出VCR-PESP模型，利用SMT方法支持连续时间求解，避免离散化误差，并通过真实数据验证。

Result: 集成方法显著减少车辆需求，优于SAT和MIP模型，且在大型网络中仍能高效求解。

Conclusion: SMT为集成铁路规划提供了有效工具，通过连续时间求解提高了效率和实用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for jointly solving the periodic Train
Timetabling Problem (TTP), train routing, and Vehicle Circulation Problem (VCP)
through a unified optimization model. While these planning stages are
traditionally addressed sequentially, their interdependencies often lead to
suboptimal vehicle usage. We propose the VCR-PESP, an integrated formulation
that minimizes fleet size while ensuring feasible and infrastructure-compliant
periodic timetables. We present the first Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT)-based method for the VCR-PESP to solve the resulting large-scale
instances. Unlike the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT), which requires time
discretisation, SMT supports continuous time via difference constraints,
eliminating the trade-off between temporal precision and encoding size. Our
approach avoids rounding artifacts and scales effectively, outperforming both
SAT and Mixed Integer Program (MIP) models across non-trivial instances. Using
real-world data from the Swiss narrow-gauge operator RhB, we conduct extensive
experiments to assess the impact of time discretisation, vehicle circulation
strategies, route flexibility, and planning integration. We show that discrete
models inflate vehicle requirements and that fully integrated solutions
substantially reduce fleet needs compared to sequential approaches. Our
framework consistently delivers high-resolution solutions with tractable
runtimes, even in large and complex networks. By combining modeling accuracy
with scalable solver technology, this work establishes SMT as a powerful tool
for integrated railway planning. It demonstrates how relaxing discretisation
and solving across planning layers enables more efficient and implementable
timetables.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了两种无目标函数优化的噪声容忍算法，处理边界约束和不精确梯度，并利用二阶信息。一种是多层次方法，另一种是域分解方法，均为AdaGrad算法的推广。理论证明了两种方法的高效性和收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对无目标函数优化问题，处理边界约束、不精确梯度和噪声，同时利用二阶信息提升效率。

Method: 提出两种算法：多层次方法和域分解方法，均为AdaGrad算法的推广，并共享统一的理论框架。

Result: 理论证明两种方法能以高概率在$O(\\epsilon^{-2})$次迭代内找到$\\epsilon$-近似临界点。数值实验验证了其高效性。

Conclusion: 两种算法在理论和实验中均表现出高效性，适用于从PDE问题到深度神经网络的广泛应用。

Abstract: Two OFFO (Objective-Function Free Optimization) noise tolerant algorithms are
presented that handle bound constraints, inexact gradients and use second-order
information when available.The first is a multi-level method exploiting a
hierarchical description of the problem and the second is a
domain-decomposition method covering the standard addditive Schwarz
decompositions. Both are generalizations of the first-order AdaGrad algorithm
for unconstrained optimization. Because these algorithms share a common
theoretical framework, a single convergence/complexity theory is provided which
covers them both. Its main result is that, with high probability, both methods
need at most $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and noisy gradient evaluations to
compute an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order critical point of the
bound-constrained problem. Extensive numerical experiments are discussed on
applications ranging from PDE-based problems to deep neural network training,
illustrating their remarkable computational efficiency.

### [13] [Learning to Quantize and Precode in Massive MIMO Systems for Energy Reduction: a Graph Neural Network Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10634)
*Thomas Feys,Liesbet Van der Perre,François Rottenberg*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文研究了大规模MIMO系统中粗量化下行链路非线性预编码的节能方法，提出了一种基于图神经网络的自监督训练模型，显著提升了速率并降低了DAC功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模MIMO系统中，随着射频链数量、载波频率和带宽的增加，DAC成为硬件复杂性和功耗的瓶颈。本文旨在通过非线性预编码技术解决粗量化下的这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的模型，通过自监督学习直接输出预编码量化向量，并使用Gumbel-softmax梯度估计解决目标函数的不可微问题。

Result: 在粗量化条件下，该方法显著提升了可达速率。例如，单用户情况下，1位DAC即可达到与3位DAC的MRT相同的速率，降低了功耗。

Conclusion: 该方法在大规模MIMO系统中实现了显著的功耗降低，尤其在带宽有限的情况下效果明显，但同时也增加了数字信号处理的功耗。

Abstract: Massive MIMO systems are moving toward increased numbers of radio frequency
chains, higher carrier frequencies and larger bandwidths. As such,
digital-to-analog converters (DACs) are becoming a bottleneck in terms of
hardware complexity and power consumption. In this work, non-linear precoding
for coarsely quantized downlink massive MIMO is studied. Given the NP-hard
nature of this problem, a graph neural network (GNN) is proposed that directly
outputs the precoded quantized vector based on the channel matrix and the
intended transmit symbols. The model is trained in a self-supervised manner, by
directly maximizing the achievable rate. To overcome the non-differentiability
of the objective function, introduced due to the non-differentiable DAC
functions, a straight-through Gumbel-softmax estimation of the gradient is
proposed. The proposed method achieves a significant increase in achievable sum
rate under coarse quantization. For instance, in the single-user case, the
proposed method can achieve the same sum rate as maximum ratio transmission
(MRT) by using one-bit DAC's as compared to 3 bits for MRT. This reduces the
DAC's power consumption by a factor 4-7 and 3 for baseband and RF DACs
respectively. This, however, comes at the cost of increased digital signal
processing power consumption. When accounting for this, the reduction in
overall power consumption holds for a system bandwidth up to 3.5 MHz for
baseband DACs, while the RF DACs can maintain a power reduction of 2.9 for
higher bandwidths. Notably, indirect effects, which further reduce the power
consumption, such as a reduced fronthaul consumption and reduction in other
components, are not considered in this analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法在两种物理无限网络上验证了有效性，为无限网络的安全认证提供了一种可行的数据驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Infinite networks are complex interconnected systems comprising a countably
infinite number of subsystems, where counting them precisely poses a
significant challenge due to the seemingly endless interconnected nature of the
network (e.g., counting vehicles on the road). In such scenarios, the presence
of infinitely many subsystems within the network renders the existing analysis
frameworks tailored for finite networks inapplicable to infinite ones. This
paper is concerned with offering a data-driven approach, within a compositional
framework, for the safety certification of infinite networks with both unknown
mathematical models and interconnection topologies. Given the immense
computational complexity stemming from the extensive dimension of infinite
networks, our approach capitalizes on the joint dissipativity-type properties
of subsystems, characterized by storage certificates. We introduce innovative
compositional data-driven conditions to construct a barrier certificate for the
infinite network leveraging storage certificates of its unknown subsystems
derived from data, while offering correctness guarantees across the network
safety. We demonstrate that our compositional data-driven reasoning eliminates
the requirement for checking the traditional dissipativity condition, which
typically mandates precise knowledge of the interconnection topology. In
addition, while existing data-driven literature demonstrates an exponential
trend in sample complexity with respect to network size, we showcase that our
compositional strategy notably reduces it to a linear scale in terms of the
number of subsystems. We illustrate our data-driven results on two physical
infinite networks with unknown models and interconnection topologies.

*Pau de las Heras Molins,Eric Roy-Almonacid,Dong Ho Lee,Lasse Peters,David Fridovich-Keil,Georgios Bakirtzis*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为'lexicographic IBR over time'的方法，用于解决自动驾驶车辆在多目标优先级博弈中的计算复杂性增长问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要在多目标（如最小化行驶时间、确保安全、交通协调）间进行权衡，现有的博弈模型在时间、参与者或优先级增加时计算复杂度快速上升。

Method: 通过近似求解方法——词典迭代最佳响应（IBR）结合滚动时域框架，利用历史信息加速收敛。

Result: 模拟交通场景显示，该方法能高效计算近似最优解，并收敛于广义纳什均衡。

Conclusion: lexicographic IBR over time能有效解决多目标优先级博弈的计算复杂度问题，适用于自动驾驶领域。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must balance ranked objectives, such as minimizing travel
time, ensuring safety, and coordinating with traffic. Games of ordered
preference effectively model these interactions but become computationally
intractable as the time horizon, number of players, or number of preference
levels increase. While receding horizon frameworks mitigate long-horizon
intractability by solving sequential shorter games, often warm-started, they do
not resolve the complexity growth inherent in existing methods for solving
games of ordered preference. This paper introduces a solution strategy that
avoids excessive complexity growth by approximating solutions using
lexicographic iterated best response (IBR) in receding horizon, termed
"lexicographic IBR over time." Lexicographic IBR over time uses past
information to accelerate convergence. We demonstrate through simulated traffic
scenarios that lexicographic IBR over time efficiently computes
approximate-optimal solutions for receding horizon games of ordered preference,
converging towards generalized Nash equilibria.

Result: 通过NVIDIA Sionna的射线追踪信道数据仿真，吞吐量比基准策略提升高达36.60%。

Conclusion: CPRS方法在不依赖CSI反馈的情况下显著提升了动态环境中的数据传输效率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Reducing feedback overhead in beyond 5G networks is a critical challenge, as
the growing number of antennas in modern massive MIMO systems substantially
increases the channel state information (CSI) feedback demand in frequency
division duplex (FDD) systems. To address this, extensive research has focused
on CSI compression and prediction, with neural network-based approaches gaining
momentum and being considered for integration into the 3GPP 5G-Advanced
standards. While deep learning has been effectively applied to CSI-limited
beamforming and handover optimization, reference signal allocation under such
constraints remains surprisingly underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce
the concept of channel prediction-based reference signal allocation (CPRS),
which jointly optimizes channel prediction and DM-RS allocation to improve data
throughput without requiring CSI feedback. We further propose a
standards-compliant ViViT/CNN-based architecture that implements CPRS by
treating evolving CSI matrices as sequential image-like data, enabling
efficient and adaptive transmission in dynamic environments. Simulation results
using ray-tracing channel data generated in NVIDIA Sionna validate the proposed
method, showing up to 36.60% throughput improvement over benchmark strategies.

Result: 获得最优蜜罐比例和信号策略，虚拟博弈算法收敛于最优均衡。

Conclusion: 所提方法在CPS防御中有效且适用。

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are facing a fast-growing wave of attacks. To
achieve effective proactive defense, this paper models honeypot deployment as a
gamma-fixed signaling game in which node liveness serves as the only signal and
normal-node signal gamma is exogenously fixed. We define the gamma-perfect
Bayesian-Nash equilibrium (gamma-PBNE). Analytical expressions are obtained for
all gamma-PBNEs, revealing three distinct equilibrium regimes that depend on
the priori honeypot ratio. Furthermore, the optimal honeypot ratio and
signaling strategy that jointly maximize the network average utility are
obtained. To capture strategic interaction over time, we develop a
discrete-time fictitious-play algorithm that couples Bayesian belief updates
with empirical best responses. We prove that, as long as the honeypot ratio is
perturbed within a non-degenerate neighbourhood of the optimum, every
fictitious-play path converges to the defender-optimal gamma-PBNE. Numerical
results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate its
applicability to CPS defense.

Result: 提出的方法在状态空间滤波和动态时间高斯过程回归中表现出更好的资源使用与估计精度权衡。

Conclusion: 通过优化测量速率和辅助状态动态，有效提升了卡尔曼滤波的性能，验证了方法在复杂场景下的实用性。

Abstract: We study the Continuous-Discrete Kalman Filter (CD-KF) for State-Space Models
(SSMs) where continuous-time dynamics are observed via multiple sensors with
discrete, irregularly timed measurements. Our focus extends to scenarios in
which the measurement process is coupled with the states of an auxiliary SSM.
For instance, higher measurement rates may increase energy consumption or heat
generation, while a sensor's accuracy can depend on its own spatial trajectory
or that of the measured target. Each sensor thus carries distinct costs and
constraints associated with its measurement rate and additional constraints and
costs on the auxiliary state. We model measurement occurrences as independent
Poisson processes with sensor-specific rates and derive an upper bound on the
mean posterior covariance matrix of the CD-KF along the mean auxiliary state.
The bound is continuously differentiable with respect to the measurement rates,
which enables efficient gradient-based optimization. Exploiting this bound, we
propose a finite-horizon optimal control framework to optimize measurement
rates and auxiliary-state dynamics jointly. We further introduce a
deterministic method for scheduling measurement times from the optimized rates.
Empirical results in state-space filtering and dynamic temporal Gaussian
process regression demonstrate that our approach achieves improved trade-offs
between resource usage and estimation accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MCI在碳核算和电网灵活性优化中的局限性，提出其不可靠且难以验证的问题。

Method: 分析MCI的根本限制，包括不可观测性、依赖不透明的预测模型以及缺乏可验证性。

Result: MCI无法反映高碳源导致的削减，也不能显示可用剩余电量。

Conclusion: 建议超越MCI，研究更实用的指标，如直接报告剩余电量、明确建模储能和电网稳定性等。

Abstract: Marginal Carbon Intensity (MCI) has been promoted as an effective metric for
carbon-aware computing. Although it is already considered as impractical for
carbon accounting purposes, many still view it as valuable when optimizing for
grid flexibility by incentivizing electricity usage during curtailment periods.
In this statement paper, we argue that MCI is neither reliable nor actionable
for either purpose. We outline its fundamental limitations, including
non-observability, reliance on opaque predictive models, and the lack of
verifiability. Moreover, MCI fails to reflect curtailment caused by high-carbon
sources and offers no insight into the quantity of available excess power. We
advocate moving beyond MCI and instead call for research on more actionable
metrics, such as direct reporting of excess power, explicit modeling of energy
storage and grid stability, and integration with emerging granular renewable
energy certificate markets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过逆最优控制学习演示者的最优策略或理解其意图时，噪声演示中的不等式约束会严重影响估计准确性，传统方法对此处理不足。

Method: 利用精确惩罚函数，减少未知变量数量，并通过近似方法处理错误的约束激活。

Result: 仿真实验表明，该方法在噪声环境下优于传统松弛方法。

Conclusion: 提出的惩罚函数方法提高了逆最优控制在噪声环境中的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Inverse optimal control (IOC) is a promising paradigm for learning and
mimicking optimal control strategies from capable demonstrators, or gaining a
deeper understanding of their intentions, by estimating an unknown objective
function from one or more corresponding optimal control sequences. When
computing estimates from demonstrations in environments with safety-preserving
inequality constraints, acknowledging their presence in the chosen IOC method
is crucial given their strong influence on the final control strategy. However,
solution strategies capable of considering inequality constraints, such as the
inverse Karush-Kuhn-Tucker approach, rely on their correct activation and
fulfillment; a restrictive assumption when dealing with noisy demonstrations.
To overcome this problem, we leverage the concept of exact penalty functions
for IOC and show preservation of estimation accuracy. Considering noisy
demonstrations, we then illustrate how the usage of penalty functions reduces
the number of unknown variables and how their approximations enhance the
estimation method's capacity to account for wrong constraint activations within
a polytopic-constrained environment. The proposed method is evaluated for three
systems in simulation, outperforming traditional relaxation approaches for
noisy demonstrations.

Motivation: 传统的鲁棒模型预测控制（MPC）过于保守，而随机MPC方法在不确定性分布未知时表现不佳。需要一种新方法以减少保守性并确保机会约束的严格满足。

Method: 提出RAAR-MPC框架，结合高斯过程回归和主动学习的风险评估引擎，以及自适应安全裕度的更新机制，实现双时间尺度的风险调节。

Result: 框架在非稳态不确定性下严格满足用户定义的风险水平，数值实验显示其平均成本显著低于现有鲁棒和随机MPC方法。

Conclusion: RAAR-MPC通过学习和适应性调节，成功降低了保守性并确保机会约束的满足，为复杂不确定性系统的控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Solving chance-constrained optimal control problems for systems subject to
non-stationary uncertainties is a significant challenge.Conventional robust
model predictive control (MPC) often yields excessive conservatism by relying
on static worst-case assumptions, while standard stochastic MPC methods
struggle when underlying uncertainty distributions are unknown a priori.This
article presents a Risk-Aware Adaptive Robust MPC (RAAR-MPC) framework,a
hierarchical architecture that systematically orchestrates a novel synthesis of
proactive, learning-based risk assessment and reactive risk regulation. The
framework employs a medium-frequency risk assessment engine, which leverages
Gaussian process regression and active learning, to construct a tight,
data-driven characterization of the prediction error set from operational
data.Concurrently, a low-timescale outer loop implements a self-correcting
update law for an adaptive safety margin to precisely regulate the empirical
risk and compensate for unmodeled dynamics.This dual-timescale adaptation
enables the system to rigorously satisfy chance constraints with a user-defined
probability, while minimizing the conservatism inherent in traditional
approaches.We formally establish that the interplay between these adaptive
components guarantees recursive feasibility and ensures the closed-loop system
satisfies the chance constraints up to a user-defined risk level with high
probability.Numerical experiments on a benchmark DC-DC converter under
non-stationary parametric uncertainties demonstrate that our framework
precisely achieves the target risk level, resulting in a significantly lower
average cost compared to state-of-the-art robust and stochastic MPC strategies.

Result: 实验表明，OSMPs在多种机器人平台上表现优异，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: OSMPs显著提升了周期性运动的学习和泛化能力，扩展了动态运动原语的应用范围。

Abstract: Learning from demonstration provides a sample-efficient approach to acquiring
complex behaviors, enabling robots to move robustly, compliantly, and with
fluidity. In this context, Dynamic Motion Primitives offer built - in stability
and robustness to disturbances but often struggle to capture complex periodic
behaviors. Moreover, they are limited in their ability to interpolate between
different tasks. These shortcomings substantially narrow their applicability,
excluding a wide class of practically meaningful tasks such as locomotion and
rhythmic tool use. In this work, we introduce Orbitally Stable Motion
Primitives (OSMPs) - a framework that combines a learned diffeomorphic encoder
with a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in latent space, enabling the accurate
acquisition of periodic motions from demonstrations while ensuring formal
guarantees of orbital stability and transverse contraction. Furthermore, by
conditioning the bijective encoder on the task, we enable a single learned
policy to represent multiple motion objectives, yielding consistent zero-shot
generalization to unseen motion objectives within the training distribution. We
validate the proposed approach through extensive simulation and real-world
experiments across a diverse range of robotic platforms - from collaborative
arms and soft manipulators to a bio-inspired rigid-soft turtle robot -
demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines such as diffusion policies, among others.

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models represent a transformative shift in
robotics, with the aim of unifying visual perception, natural language
understanding, and embodied control within a single learning framework. This
review presents a comprehensive and forward-looking synthesis of the VLA
paradigm, with a particular emphasis on robotic manipulation and
instruction-driven autonomy. We comprehensively analyze 102 VLA models, 26
foundational datasets, and 12 simulation platforms that collectively shape the
development and evaluation of VLAs models. These models are categorized into
key architectural paradigms, each reflecting distinct strategies for
integrating vision, language, and control in robotic systems. Foundational
datasets are evaluated using a novel criterion based on task complexity,
variety of modalities, and dataset scale, allowing a comparative analysis of
their suitability for generalist policy learning. We introduce a
two-dimensional characterization framework that organizes these datasets based
on semantic richness and multimodal alignment, showing underexplored regions in
the current data landscape. Simulation environments are evaluated for their
effectiveness in generating large-scale data, as well as their ability to
facilitate transfer from simulation to real-world settings and the variety of
supported tasks. Using both academic and industrial contributions, we recognize
ongoing challenges and outline strategic directions such as scalable
pretraining protocols, modular architectural design, and robust multimodal
alignment strategies. This review serves as both a technical reference and a
conceptual roadmap for advancing embodiment and robotic control, providing
insights that span from dataset generation to real world deployment of
generalist robotic agents.

Conclusion: 软生长机器人可作为有效的非结构化环境探索和地图工具。

Abstract: Passive deformation due to compliance is a commonly used benefit of soft
robots, providing opportunities to achieve robust actuation with few active
degrees of freedom. Soft growing robots in particular have shown promise in
navigation of unstructured environments due to their passive deformation. If
their collisions and subsequent deformations can be better understood, soft
robots could be used to understand the structure of the environment from direct
tactile measurements. In this work, we propose the use of soft growing robots
as mapping and exploration tools. We do this by first characterizing collision
behavior during discrete turns, then leveraging this model to develop a
geometry-based simulator that models robot trajectories in 2D environments.
Finally, we demonstrate the model and simulator validity by mapping unknown
environments using Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the optimal next deployment
given current knowledge. Over both uniform and non-uniform environments, this
selection method rapidly approaches ideal actions, showing the potential for
soft growing robots in unstructured environment exploration and mapping.

Abstract: Safety-critical scenarios are essential for training and evaluating
autonomous driving (AD) systems, yet remain extremely rare in real-world
driving datasets. To address this, we propose Real-world Crash Grounding (RCG),
a scenario generation framework that integrates crash-informed semantics into
adversarial perturbation pipelines. We construct a safety-aware behavior
representation through contrastive pre-training on large-scale driving logs,
followed by fine-tuning on a small, crash-rich dataset with approximate
trajectory annotations extracted from video. This embedding captures semantic
structure aligned with real-world accident behaviors and supports selection of
adversary trajectories that are both high-risk and behaviorally realistic. We
incorporate the resulting selection mechanism into two prior scenario
generation pipelines, replacing their handcrafted scoring objectives with an
embedding-based criterion. Experimental results show that ego agents trained
against these generated scenarios achieve consistently higher downstream
success rates, with an average improvement of 9.2% across seven evaluation
settings. Qualitative and quantitative analyses further demonstrate that our
approach produces more plausible and nuanced adversary behaviors, enabling more
effective and realistic stress testing of AD systems. Code and tools will be
released publicly.

Motivation: 解决现有未见物体实例分割（UOIS）方法在静态视觉特征上过拟合、泛化能力差的问题，强调视觉的交互性和时间性。

Method: 基于机器人交互和体帧不变特征（BFIF），实时生成和更新物体分割掩码，无需等待动作完成。

Result: 平均分割准确率比现有UOIS方法高27.5%，并可作为视觉基础模型的提示以进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: rt-RISeg是一种独立且有效的交互感知框架，能显著提升未见物体的分割性能。

Abstract: Successful execution of dexterous robotic manipulation tasks in new
environments, such as grasping, depends on the ability to proficiently segment
unseen objects from the background and other objects. Previous works in unseen
object instance segmentation (UOIS) train models on large-scale datasets, which
often leads to overfitting on static visual features. This dependency results
in poor generalization performance when confronted with out-of-distribution
scenarios. To address this limitation, we rethink the task of UOIS based on the
principle that vision is inherently interactive and occurs over time. We
propose a novel real-time interactive perception framework, rt-RISeg, that
continuously segments unseen objects by robot interactions and analysis of a
designed body frame-invariant feature (BFIF). We demonstrate that the relative
rotational and linear velocities of randomly sampled body frames, resulting
from selected robot interactions, can be used to identify objects without any
learned segmentation model. This fully self-contained segmentation pipeline
generates and updates object segmentation masks throughout each robot
interaction without the need to wait for an action to finish. We showcase the
effectiveness of our proposed interactive perception method by achieving an
average object segmentation accuracy rate 27.5% greater than state-of-the-art
UOIS methods. Furthermore, although rt-RISeg is a standalone framework, we show
that the autonomously generated segmentation masks can be used as prompts to
vision foundation models for significantly improved performance.

Abstract: General-purpose robotic manipulation, including reach and grasp, is essential
for deployment into households and workspaces involving diverse and evolving
tasks. Recent advances propose using large pre-trained models, such as Large
Language Models and object detectors, to boost robotic perception in
reinforcement learning. These models, trained on large datasets via
self-supervised learning, can process text prompts and identify diverse objects
in scenes, an invaluable skill in RL where learning object interaction is
resource-intensive. This study demonstrates how to integrate such models into
Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning to enable general and versatile robotic
reach and grasp capabilities. We use a pre-trained object detection model to
enable the agent to identify the object from a text prompt and generate a mask
for goal conditioning. Mask-based goal conditioning provides object-agnostic
cues, improving feature sharing and generalization. The effectiveness of the
proposed framework is demonstrated in a simulated reach-and-grasp task, where
the mask-based goal conditioning consistently maintains a $\sim$90\% success
rate in grasping both in and out-of-distribution objects, while also ensuring
faster convergence to higher returns.

Abstract: Merging onto a highway is a complex driving task that requires identifying a
safe gap, adjusting speed, often interactions to create a merging gap, and
completing the merge maneuver within a limited time window while maintaining
safety and driving comfort. In this paper, we introduce a Safe Merging and
Real-Time Merge (SMART-Merge) planner, a lattice-based motion planner designed
to facilitate safe and comfortable forced merging. By deliberately adapting
cost terms to the unique challenges of forced merging and introducing a desired
speed heuristic, SMART-Merge planner enables the ego vehicle to merge
successfully while minimizing the merge time. We verify the efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed merge planner through high-fidelity CarMaker
simulations on hundreds of highway merge scenarios. Our proposed planner
achieves the success rate of 100% as well as completes the merge maneuver in
the shortest amount of time compared with the baselines, demonstrating our
planner's capability to handle complex forced merge tasks and provide a
reliable and robust solution for autonomous highway merge. The simulation

Conclusion: GCS和SWP为机器人混合离散连续规划提供了一种通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the Shortest-Walk Problem (SWP) in a Graph of Convex Sets (GCS). A
GCS is a graph where each vertex is paired with a convex program, and each edge
couples adjacent programs via additional costs and constraints. A walk in a GCS
is a sequence of vertices connected by edges, where vertices may be repeated.
The length of a walk is given by the cumulative optimal value of the
corresponding convex programs. To solve the SWP in GCS, we first synthesize a
piecewise-quadratic lower bound on the problem's cost-to-go function using
semidefinite programming. Then we use this lower bound to guide an
incremental-search algorithm that yields an approximate shortest walk. We show
that the SWP in GCS is a natural language for many mixed discrete-continuous
planning problems in robotics, unifying problems that typically require
specialized solutions while delivering high performance and computational
efficiency. We demonstrate this through experiments in collision-free motion
planning, skill chaining, and optimal control of hybrid systems.

integrates a dual-camera perception setup with a B-spline-based model

global trajectories from partial and uncertain observations. As new visual data
are incrementally fused, both the environment model and motion planning are
progressively refined. A vision-based cost function promotes target-driven
exploration, while a refined kernel-perceptron collision detector enables
efficient constraint updates for real-time planning. The framework accommodates
closed-chain kinematics and supports dynamic replanning. Experiments on a

Abstract: Imitation learning for mobile manipulation is a key challenge in the field of
robotic manipulation. However, current mobile manipulation frameworks typically
decouple navigation and manipulation, executing manipulation only after
reaching a certain location. This can lead to performance degradation when
navigation is imprecise, especially due to misalignment in approach angles. To
enable a mobile manipulator to perform the same task from diverse orientations,
an essential capability for building general-purpose robotic models, we propose
an object-centric method based on SAM2, a foundation model towards solving
promptable visual segmentation in images, which incorporates manipulation
orientation information into our model. Our approach enables consistent
understanding of the same task from different orientations. We deploy the model
on a custom-built mobile manipulator and evaluate it on a pick-and-place task
under varied orientation angles. Compared to Action Chunking Transformer, our
model maintains superior generalization when trained with demonstrations from
varied approach angles. This work significantly enhances the generalization and
robustness of imitation learning-based mobile manipulation systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a diffusion-augmented reinforcement learning (RL)
approach for robust autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) control, addressing key
challenges in underwater trajectory planning and dynamic environment
adaptation. The proposed method integrates three core innovations: (1) A
diffusion-based trajectory generation framework that produces physically
feasible multi-step trajectories, enhanced by a high-dimensional state encoding
mechanism combining current observations with historical states and actions
through a novel diffusion U-Net architecture, significantly improving
long-horizon planning. (2) A sample-efficient hybrid learning architecture that
synergizes diffusion-guided exploration with RL policy optimization, where the
diffusion model generates diverse candidate actions and the RL critic selects
optimal actions, achieving higher exploration efficiency and policy stability
in dynamic underwater environments. Extensive simulation experiments validating
the method's superior robustness and flexibility, outperforms conventional
control methods in challenging marine conditions, offering enhanced
adaptability and reliability for AUV operations in the underwater tasks.

Conclusion: M-GAPS在灵活性、稳定性和数据效率方面优于经典自适应控制和模型无关的强化学习方法。

Abstract: We study online algorithms to tune the parameters of a robot controller in a
setting where the dynamics, policy class, and optimality objective are all
time-varying. The system follows a single trajectory without episodes or state
resets, and the time-varying information is not known in advance. Focusing on
nonlinear geometric quadrotor controllers as a test case, we propose a
practical implementation of a single-trajectory model-based online policy
optimization algorithm, M-GAPS,along with reparameterizations of the quadrotor
state space and policy class to improve the optimization landscape. In hardware
experiments,we compare to model-based and model-free baselines that impose
artificial episodes. We show that M-GAPS finds near-optimal parameters more
quickly, especially when the episode length is not favorable. We also show that
M-GAPS rapidly adapts to heavy unmodeled wind and payload disturbances, and
achieves similar strong improvement on a 1:6-scale Ackermann-steered car. Our
results demonstrate the hardware practicality of this emerging class of online
policy optimization that offers significantly more flexibility than classic
adaptive control, while being more stable and data-efficient than model-free
reinforcement learning.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified modeling and optimization framework to enhance
the kinematic performance of multi-magnet embedded soft continuum robots
(MeSCRs). To this end, we establish a differentiable system formulation based
on an extended pseudo-rigid-body model. This formulation enables analysis of
the equilibrium well-posedness and the geometry of the induced configuration
under magnetic actuation. In particular, we show that the maximum controllable
degrees of freedom of a MeSCR equal twice the number of embedded magnets. We
subsequently develop a structural optimization framework based on differential
geometry that links classical kinematic measures (e.g., manipulability and
dexterity) to the configuration of embedded magnets. The resulting optimization
condition reveals that improving local performance requires structurally
modulating the spectrum of the configuration space metric to counteract its
distortion. Closed-form solutions for optimal magnet configurations are derived
under representative conditions, and a gradient-based numerical method is
proposed for general design scenarios. Simulation studies validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: This paper presents a state-estimation solution for legged robots that uses a
set of low-cost, compact, and lightweight sensors to achieve low-drift pose and
velocity estimation under challenging locomotion conditions. The key idea is to
leverage multiple inertial measurement units on different links of the robot to
correct a major error source in standard proprioceptive odometry. We fuse the
inertial sensor information and joint encoder measurements in an extended
Kalman filter, then combine the velocity estimate from this filter with camera
data in a factor-graph-based sliding-window estimator to form a
visual-inertial-leg odometry method. We validate our state estimator through
comprehensive theoretical analysis and hardware experiments performed using
real-world robot data collected during a variety of challenging locomotion
tasks. Our algorithm consistently achieves minimal position deviation, even in
scenarios involving substantial ground impact, foot slippage, and sudden body
rotations. A C++ implementation, along with a large-scale dataset, is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多用户环境中社交机器人需要更智能的决策能力，以确定何时及对谁做出响应，传统单用户研究无法满足需求。

Method: 采用Transformer多任务学习框架，提出两种新损失函数（约束主动说话者和引导响应选择），并构建多用户HRI数据集。

Result: 模型在响应决策上达到最先进性能，优于启发式和单任务方法。

Conclusion: 该框架提升了社交机器人在多用户互动中的自然性和情境感知能力，推动了社交机器人的智能化发展。

Abstract: Prior human-robot interaction (HRI) research has primarily focused on
single-user interactions, where robots do not need to consider the timing or
recipient of their responses. However, in multi-party interactions, such as at
malls and hospitals, social robots must understand the context and decide both
when and to whom they should respond. In this paper, we propose a
Transformer-based multi-task learning framework to improve the decision-making
process of social robots, particularly in multi-user environments. Considering
the characteristics of HRI, we propose two novel loss functions: one that
enforces constraints on active speakers to improve scene modeling, and another
that guides response selection towards utterances specifically directed at the
robot. Additionally, we construct a novel multi-party HRI dataset that captures
real-world complexities, such as gaze misalignment. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in respond
decisions, outperforming existing heuristic-based and single-task approaches.
Our findings contribute to the development of socially intelligent social
robots capable of engaging in natural and context-aware multi-party
interactions.

Conclusion: EquiContact框架及设计的三大关键组件（合规性、局部策略和诱导等价性）有效提升了接触密集任务的空间泛化性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for learning vision-based robotic policies
for contact-rich manipulation tasks that generalize spatially across task
configurations. We focus on achieving robust spatial generalization of the
policy for the peg-in-hole (PiH) task trained from a small number of
demonstrations. We propose EquiContact, a hierarchical policy composed of a
high-level vision planner (Diffusion Equivariant Descriptor Field, Diff-EDF)
and a novel low-level compliant visuomotor policy (Geometric Compliant ACT,
G-CompACT). G-CompACT operates using only localized observations (geometrically
consistent error vectors (GCEV), force-torque readings, and wrist-mounted RGB
images) and produces actions defined in the end-effector frame. Through these
design choices, we show that the entire EquiContact pipeline is
SE(3)-equivariant, from perception to force control. We also outline three key
components for spatially generalizable contact-rich policies: compliance,
localized policies, and induced equivariance. Real-world experiments on PiH
tasks demonstrate a near-perfect success rate and robust generalization to
unseen spatial configurations, validating the proposed framework and
principles. The experimental videos can be found on the project website:

Abstract: Vision-based underwater robots can be useful in inspecting and exploring
confined spaces where traditional sensors and preplanned paths cannot be
followed. Sensor noise and situational change can cause significant uncertainty
in environmental representation. Thus, this paper explores how to represent
mapping inconsistency in vision-based sensing and incorporate depth estimation
confidence into the mapping framework. The scene depth and the confidence are
estimated using the RAFT-Stereo model and are integrated into a voxel-based
mapping framework, Voxblox. Improvements in the existing Voxblox weight
calculation and update mechanism are also proposed. Finally, a qualitative
analysis of the proposed method is performed in a confined pool and in a pier
in the Trondheim fjord. Experiments using an underwater robot demonstrated the
change in uncertainty in the visualization.

Motivation: 目标是从演示中学习时序约束，以重现类似演示的逻辑约束行为。由于可能的规范组合空间巨大且非马尔可夫约束的模糊性，这一任务具有挑战性。

Method: ILCL方法将问题建模为双人零和游戏：1) GA-TL-Mining高效构建参数化截断线性时序逻辑（TLTL）的语法树；2) Logic-CRL通过约束重新分配方案找到在TLTL约束下最大化任务奖励的策略。

Result: 实验表明，ILCL在四个时序约束任务中优于现有基准方法，并成功应用于现实世界的浅孔插钉任务。

Conclusion: ILCL是一种有效的时序约束学习方法，能够高效地从演示中提取并应用逻辑约束。

Abstract: We aim to solve the problem of temporal-constraint learning from
demonstrations to reproduce demonstration-like logic-constrained behaviors.
Learning logic constraints is challenging due to the combinatorially large
space of possible specifications and the ill-posed nature of non-Markovian
constraints. To figure it out, we introduce a novel temporal-constraint
learning method, which we call inverse logic-constraint learning (ILCL). Our
method frames ICL as a two-player zero-sum game between 1) a genetic
algorithm-based temporal-logic mining (GA-TL-Mining) and 2) logic-constrained
reinforcement learning (Logic-CRL). GA-TL-Mining efficiently constructs syntax
trees for parameterized truncated linear temporal logic (TLTL) without
predefined templates. Subsequently, Logic-CRL finds a policy that maximizes
task rewards under the constructed TLTL constraints via a novel constraint
redistribution scheme. Our evaluations show ILCL outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in learning and transferring TL constraints on four temporally
constrained tasks. We also demonstrate successful transfer to real-world
peg-in-shallow-hole tasks.

Abstract: Service robots are increasingly deployed in diverse and dynamic environments,
where both physical layouts and social contexts change over time and across
locations. In these unstructured settings, conventional navigation systems that
rely on fixed parameters often fail to generalize across scenarios, resulting
in degraded performance and reduced social acceptance. Although recent
approaches have leveraged reinforcement learning to enhance traditional
planners, these methods often fail in real-world deployments due to poor
generalization and limited simulation diversity, which hampers effective
sim-to-real transfer. To tackle these issues, we present LE-Nav, an
interpretable and scene-aware navigation framework that leverages multi-modal
large language model reasoning and conditional variational autoencoders to
adaptively tune planner hyperparameters. To achieve zero-shot scene
understanding, we utilize one-shot exemplars and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies. Additionally, a conditional variational autoencoder captures the
mapping between natural language instructions and navigation hyperparameters,
enabling expert-level tuning. Experiments show that LE-Nav can generate
hyperparameters achieving human-level tuning across diverse planners and
scenarios. Real-world navigation trials and a user study on a smart wheelchair
platform demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
quantitative metrics such as success rate, efficiency, safety, and comfort,
while receiving higher subjective scores for perceived safety and social
acceptance. Code is available at https://github.com/Cavendish518/LE-Nav.

Abstract: This study presents an advanced approach to enhance robotic manipulation in
uncertain and challenging environments, with a focus on autonomous operations
augmented by human-in-the-loop (HITL) control for lunar missions. By
integrating human decision-making with autonomous robotic functions, the
research improves task reliability and efficiency for space applications. The
key task addressed is the autonomous deployment of flexible solar panels using
an extendable ladder-like structure and a robotic manipulator with real-time
feedback for precision. The manipulator relays position and force-torque data,
enabling dynamic error detection and adaptive control during deployment. To
mitigate the effects of sinkage, variable payload, and low-lighting conditions,
efficient motion planning strategies are employed, supplemented by human
control that allows operators to intervene in ambiguous scenarios. Digital twin
simulation enhances system robustness by enabling continuous feedback,
iterative task refinement, and seamless integration with the deployment
pipeline. The system has been tested to validate its performance in simulated
lunar conditions and ensure reliability in extreme lighting, variable terrain,
changing payloads, and sensor limitations.

Conclusion: TRAN-D在稀疏视角和动态环境下表现优异，显著提升了透明物体的3D重建质量。

Abstract: Understanding the 3D geometry of transparent objects from RGB images is
challenging due to their inherent physical properties, such as reflection and
refraction. To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse
views and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian
Splatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key
insight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling
focused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate
artifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions,
ensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting.
Furthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the
reconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and
chain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning.
TRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it
consistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based
state-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean
absolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore,
despite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\delta} < 2.5 cm
accuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.

Abstract: Derivatives of equations of motion(EOM) describing the dynamics of rigid body
systems are becoming increasingly relevant for the robotics community and find
many applications in design and control of robotic systems. Controlling robots,
and multibody systems comprising elastic components in particular, not only
requires smooth trajectories but also the time derivatives of the control
forces/torques, hence of the EOM. This paper presents the time derivatives of
the EOM in closed form up to second-order as an alternative formulation to the
existing recursive algorithms for this purpose, which provides a direct insight
into the structure of the derivatives. The Lie group formulation for rigid body
systems is used giving rise to very compact and easily parameterized equations.

Abstract: Diagnostic activities, such as ultrasound scans and palpation, are relatively
low-cost. They play a crucial role in the early detection of health problems
and in assessing their progression. However, they are also error-prone
activities, which require highly skilled medical staff. The use of robotic
solutions can be key to decreasing the inherent subjectivity of the results and
reducing the waiting list. For a robot to perform palpation or ultrasound
scans, it must effectively manage physical interactions with the human body,
which greatly benefits from precise estimation of the patient's tissue
biomechanical properties. This paper assesses the accuracy and precision of a
robotic system in estimating the viscoelastic parameters of various materials,
including some tests on ex vivo tissues as a preliminary proof-of-concept
demonstration of the method's applicability to biological samples. The
measurements are compared against a ground truth derived from silicone
specimens with different viscoelastic properties, characterised using a
high-precision instrument. Experimental results show that the robotic system's
accuracy closely matches the ground truth, increasing confidence in the
potential use of robots for such clinical applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based robust feedback
linearization strategy to ensure precise trajectory tracking for an important
family of Lagrangian systems. We assume a nominal knowledge of the dynamics is
given but no a-priori bounds on the model mismatch are available. In our
approach, the key ingredient is the adoption of a regression framework based on
Gaussian Processes (GPR) to estimate the model mismatch. This estimate is added
to the outer loop of a classical feedback linearization scheme based on the
nominal knowledge available. Then, to compensate for the residual uncertainty,
we robustify the controller including an additional term whose size is designed
based on the variance provided by the GPR framework. We proved that, with high
probability, the proposed scheme is able to guarantee asymptotic tracking of a
desired trajectory. We tested numerically our strategy on a 2 degrees of
freedom planar robot.

terms of their pose accuracy against the ground-truth and against data from
real-sized vehicles. When comparing the implementation of the selected
localization algorithms to real-sized vehicles, OpenVINS has the lowest average
localization error. Although all selected localization algorithms have
overlapping error ranges, OpenVINS also performs best when applied to a
reduced-scale vehicle. When reduced-scale vehicles were compared to real-sized
vehicles, minor differences were found in translational vehicle motion
estimation accuracy. However, no significant differences were found when
comparing the estimation accuracy of rotational vehicle motion, allowing RSVRs
to be used as testing platforms for self-localization algorithms.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected public health, healthcare
systems, and daily life, especially amid resource shortages and limited
workers. This crisis has underscored the urgent need for automation in hospital
environments, particularly disinfection, which is crucial to controlling virus
transmission and improving the safety of healthcare personnel and patients.
Ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection, known for its high efficiency, has been
widely adopted in hospital settings. However, most existing research focuses on
maximizing UV coverage while paying little attention to the impact of human
activity on virus distribution. To address this issue, we propose a mobile
robotic system for UV disinfection focusing on the virus hotspot. The system
prioritizes disinfection in high-risk areas and employs an approach for
optimized UV dosage to ensure that all surfaces receive an adequate level of UV
exposure while significantly reducing disinfection time. It not only improves
disinfection efficiency but also minimizes unnecessary exposure in low-risk
areas. In two representative hospital scenarios, our method achieves the same
disinfection effectiveness while reducing disinfection time by 30.7% and 31.9%,
respectively. The video of the experiment is available at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于扩散的统一框架，通过联合优化视频和动作预测，提升双手机器人操作的协调性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双手机器人操作在工业自动化和家庭服务中具有广泛应用，但由于高维动作空间和复杂协调需求，仍然面临挑战。视频预测的潜力在此领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用了多帧潜在预测策略和单向注意力机制，将视频预测与动作预测分离，提高效率。

Result: 在两个模拟基准和一个实际实验中，成功率显著提升（ALOHA提升24.9%，RoboTwin提升11.1%，实际实验提升32.5%）。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了双手机器人操作的协调性和成功率，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation is crucial in robotics, enabling complex tasks in
industrial automation and household services. However, it poses significant
challenges due to the high-dimensional action space and intricate coordination
requirements. While video prediction has been recently studied for
representation learning and control, leveraging its ability to capture rich
dynamic and behavioral information, its potential for enhancing bimanual
coordination remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified
diffusion-based framework for the joint optimization of video and action
prediction. Specifically, we propose a multi-frame latent prediction strategy
that encodes future states in a compressed latent space, preserving
task-relevant features. Furthermore, we introduce a unidirectional attention
mechanism where video prediction is conditioned on the action, while action
prediction remains independent of video prediction. This design allows us to
omit video prediction during inference, significantly enhancing efficiency.
Experiments on two simulated benchmarks and a real-world setting demonstrate a
significant improvement in the success rate over the strong baseline ACT using
our method, achieving a \textbf{24.9\%} increase on ALOHA, an \textbf{11.1\%}
increase on RoboTwin, and a \textbf{32.5\%} increase in real-world experiments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种仅依靠视觉（事件摄像头）实现无人机姿态控制的方法，无需惯性传感器。通过训练一个小型循环卷积神经网络，展示了在实际飞行测试中的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然界中的飞行生物主要依赖视觉进行姿态控制，而现有无人机则多依赖惯性传感器。研究旨在探索仅依靠视觉实现无人机飞行控制的可行性。

Method: 使用事件摄像头和循环卷积神经网络，从事件流中估计无人机的姿态和旋转速率。

Result: 飞行测试表明，该方法能够替代传统飞行控制中的惯性测量单元，并在不同环境中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 视觉仅控制为小型自主飞行机器人提供了一种有前景的技术方案。

Abstract: Vision is an essential part of attitude control for many flying animals, some
of which have no dedicated sense of gravity. Flying robots, on the other hand,
typically depend heavily on accelerometers and gyroscopes for attitude
stabilization. In this work, we present the first vision-only approach to
flight control for use in generic environments. We show that a quadrotor drone
equipped with a downward-facing event camera can estimate its attitude and
rotation rate from just the event stream, enabling flight control without
inertial sensors. Our approach uses a small recurrent convolutional neural
network trained through supervised learning. Real-world flight tests
demonstrate that our combination of event camera and low-latency neural network
is capable of replacing the inertial measurement unit in a traditional flight
control loop. Furthermore, we investigate the network's generalization across
different environments, and the impact of memory and different fields of view.
While networks with memory and access to horizon-like visual cues achieve best
performance, variants with a narrower field of view achieve better relative
generalization. Our work showcases vision-only flight control as a promising
candidate for enabling autonomous, insect-scale flying robots.

Abstract: Robotic task execution faces challenges due to the inconsistency between
symbolic planner models and the rich control structures actually running on the
robot. In this paper, we present the first physical deployment of an integrated
actor-planner system that shares hierarchical operational models for both
acting and planning, interleaving the Reactive Acting Engine (RAE) with an
anytime UCT-like Monte Carlo planner (UPOM). We implement RAE+UPOM on a mobile

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机：现有的RoboCup Logistics League过于专注于生产物流，未能反映智能制造的近期发展，导致其相关性逐渐减弱。

Method: 方法：设计了一个更大的智能制造场景，包含多个独立的赛道，逐步整合为一个完整的智能工厂竞赛，涵盖工业机器人挑战（如组装、人机协作和人形机器人）和生产物流。

Result: 结果：新的竞赛将更具吸引力，同时聚焦于当前和未来的工业机器人挑战。

Conclusion: 结论：重新设计的竞赛能够更好地反映现代工厂需求，为参赛团队提供更丰富的挑战。

Abstract: The RoboCup Logistics League is a RoboCup competition in a smart factory
scenario that has focused on task planning, job scheduling, and multi-agent
coordination. The focus on production logistics allowed teams to develop highly
competitive strategies, but also meant that some recent developments in the
context of smart manufacturing are not reflected in the competition, weakening
its relevance over the years. In this paper, we describe the vision for the
RoboCup Smart Manufacturing League, a new competition designed as a larger
smart manufacturing scenario, reflecting all the major aspects of a modern
factory. It will consist of several tracks that are initially independent but
gradually combined into one smart manufacturing scenario. The new tracks will
cover industrial robotics challenges such as assembly, human-robot
collaboration, and humanoid robotics, but also retain a focus on production
logistics. We expect the reenvisioned competition to be more attractive to
newcomers and well-tried teams, while also shifting the focus to current and
future challenges of industrial robotics.

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration in surgery represents a significant area of
research, driven by the increasing capability of autonomous robotic systems to
assist surgeons in complex procedures. This systematic review examines the
advancements and persistent challenges in the development of autonomous
surgical robotic assistants (ASARs), focusing specifically on scenarios where
robots provide meaningful and active support to human surgeons. Adhering to the
PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted across the
IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, resulting in the selection
of 32 studies for detailed analysis. Two primary collaborative setups were
identified: teleoperation-based assistance and direct hands-on interaction. The
findings reveal a growing research emphasis on ASARs, with predominant
applications currently in endoscope guidance, alongside emerging progress in
autonomous tool manipulation. Several key challenges hinder wider adoption,
including the alignment of robotic actions with human surgeon preferences, the
necessity for procedural awareness within autonomous systems, the establishment
of seamless human-robot information exchange, and the complexities of skill
acquisition in shared workspaces. This review synthesizes current trends,
identifies critical limitations, and outlines future research directions
essential to improve the reliability, safety, and effectiveness of human-robot
collaboration in surgical environments.

Motivation: 解决多机器人在全环境信息下的点对点导航任务，同时处理动态环境和异步目标更新的挑战。

Result: 展示了框架的鲁棒性和可扩展性，包括15架真实多旋翼机器人的动态场景演示。

Conclusion: 该框架为终身多机器人导航提供了高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a multi-robot control paradigm to solve point-to-point navigation
tasks for a team of holonomic robots with access to the full environment
information. The framework invokes two processes asynchronously at high
frequency: (i) a centralized, discrete, and full-horizon planner for computing
collision- and deadlock-free paths rapidly, leveraging recent advances in
multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and (ii) dynamics-aware, robot-wise optimal
trajectory controllers that ensure all robots independently follow their
assigned paths reliably. This hierarchical shift in planning representation
from (i) discrete and coupled to (ii) continuous and decoupled domains enables
the framework to maintain long-term scalable motion synthesis. As an
instantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast
state-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack
(Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and
versatile mechanism for lifelong multi-robot navigation even under asynchronous
and partial goal updates, and adapts to dynamic workspaces simply by quick
replanning. We present various multirotor and ground robot demonstrations,
including the deployment of 15 real multirotors with random, consecutive target
updates while a person walks through the operational workspace.

Conclusion: 强化学习可以将人形机器人引入创造性音乐表演领域，展现其潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Humanoid robots have seen remarkable advances in dexterity, balance, and
locomotion, yet their role in expressive domains, such as music performance,
remains largely unexplored. Musical tasks, like drumming, present unique
challenges, including split-second timing, rapid contacts, and multi-limb
coordination over pieces lasting minutes. In this paper, we introduce Robot
Drummer, a humanoid system capable of expressive, high-precision drumming
across a diverse repertoire of songs. We formulate humanoid drumming as
sequential fulfillment of timed-contacts and transform drum scores in to a
Rhythmic Contact Chain. To handle the long-horizon nature of musical
performance, we decompose each piece into fixed-length segments and train a
single policy across all segments in parallel using reinforcement learning.
Through extensive experiments on over thirty popular rock, metal, and jazz
tracks, our results demonstrate that Robot Drummer consistently achieves high
F1 scores. The learned behaviors exhibit emergent human-like drumming
strategies, such as cross-arm strikes, and adaptive sticks assignments,
demonstrating the potential of reinforcement learning to bring humanoid robots
into the domain of creative musical performance. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自然语言指令的歧义性在安全关键的人机交互（如手术）中带来风险，需要一种方法检测并解决这些歧义。

Method: 采用多LLM评估器，结合不同提示技术识别多种歧义类型，并通过共形预测整合评估结果。

Result: 在Llama 3.2 11B和Gemma 3 12B上验证，分类准确率超过60%。

Conclusion: 该方法能提前识别潜在歧义指令，提升手术中人机协作的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Ambiguity in natural language instructions poses significant risks in
safety-critical human-robot interaction, particularly in domains such as
surgery. To address this, we propose a framework that uses Large Language
Models (LLMs) for ambiguity detection specifically designed for collaborative
surgical scenarios. Our method employs an ensemble of LLM evaluators, each
configured with distinct prompting techniques to identify linguistic,
contextual, procedural, and critical ambiguities. A chain-of-thought evaluator
is included to systematically analyze instruction structure for potential
issues. Individual evaluator assessments are synthesized through conformal
prediction, which yields non-conformity scores based on comparison to a labeled
calibration dataset. Evaluating Llama 3.2 11B and Gemma 3 12B, we observed
classification accuracy exceeding 60% in differentiating ambiguous from
unambiguous surgical instructions. Our approach improves the safety and
reliability of human-robot collaboration in surgery by offering a mechanism to
identify potentially ambiguous instructions before robot action.
