This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied\nQuestion Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past\nexperiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,\ntemporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration.

Consequently,\nemploying LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task\nexamples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained\nengineers.

Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into\nautonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in\nOOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD\nscenarios and generate user-level decisions such as \"go straight\" or \"turn\nright.\" However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between\nthe VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and\nthe low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we\npropose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with\nVerifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics.\nThis approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in\nexisting VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving\nscenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making\nunder OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment\nissue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents\nin the context of autonomous driving."}

First, we use optic\nflow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model\n(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of\nrobot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent\nPolicy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by\nsearching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real\nworld experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of\npolicies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement\nwith 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50\ndemonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand\nepisodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different\nrobots or a cost-effective human dataset from play."}

This manuscript is under review with IEEE\n  Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles", "summary": "Accurate modeling and control of autonomous vehicles remain a fundamental\nchallenge due to the nonlinear and coupled nature of vehicle dynamics. While\nKoopman operator theory offers a framework for deploying powerful linear\ncontrol techniques, learning a finite-dimensional invariant subspace for\nhigh-fidelity modeling continues to be an open problem. This paper presents a\ndeep Koopman approach for modeling and control of vehicle dynamics within the\ncurvilinear Frenet frame. The proposed framework uses a deep neural network\narchitecture to simultaneously learn the Koopman operator and its associated\ninvariant subspace from the data. Input-state bilinear interactions are\ncaptured by the algorithm while preserving convexity, which makes it suitable\nfor real-time model predictive control (MPC) application. A multi-step\nprediction loss is utilized during training to ensure long-horizon prediction\ncapability. To further enhance real-time trajectory tracking performance, the\nmodel is integrated with a cumulative error regulator (CER) module, which\ncompensates for model mismatch by mitigating accumulated prediction errors.\nClosed-loop performance is evaluated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)\nexperiments using a CarSim RT model as the target plant, with real-time\nvalidation conducted on a dSPACE SCALEXIO system. The proposed controller\nachieved significant reductions in tracking error relative to baseline\ncontrollers, confirming its suitability for real-time implementation in\nembedded autonomous vehicle systems."}
