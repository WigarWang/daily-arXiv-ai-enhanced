Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and\nautomated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs\nare not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative\non-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on\ntwo-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal\ncar-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral\nlane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for\nhuman-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human\nfactors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a\nHCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based\non the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model\nbased on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the\nelitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and\nefficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under\ndifferent traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation.

Recent advances in\nlarge-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.\nHowever, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in\nperformance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental\nchanges. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,\nwe abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:\nsimilarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the\ngrasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly\nachieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key\nsteps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform\nsimilarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,\nidentifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate\nmodels with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the\nunknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local\nfine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy\nobservation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that\nintegrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive\nevaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,\nthe C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between\npartial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database\nmodels.

While game-theoretic methods\nare widely acknowledged for their effectiveness in managing multi-agent\ninteractions, significant impediments persist when it comes to accommodating\nthe intentional uncertainties of agents. In the context of intentional\nuncertainties, the heavy computational burdens associated with existing\ngame-theoretic methods are induced, leading to inefficiencies and poor\nscalability. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic interactive\ntrajectory planning method to effectively address the intentional uncertainties\nof agents, and it demonstrates both high efficiency and enhanced scalability.\nAs the underpinning basis, we model the interactions between agents under\nintentional uncertainties as a general Bayesian game, and we show that its\nagent-form equivalence can be represented as a potential game under certain\nminor assumptions. The existence and attainability of the optimal interactive\ntrajectories are illustrated, as the corresponding Bayesian Nash equilibrium\ncan be attained by optimizing a unified optimization problem. Additionally, we\npresent a distributed algorithm based on the dual consensus alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the parallel solving of the\nproblem, thereby significantly improving the scalability. The attendant\noutcomes from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method\nis effective across a range of scenarios characterized by general forms of\nintentional uncertainties.

In this work, a uniform LGL\nmethod is proposed, termed UniLGL, which simultaneously achieves spatial and\nmaterial uniformity, as well as sensor-type uniformity. The key idea of the\nproposed method is to encode the complete point cloud, which contains both\ngeometric and material information, into a pair of BEV images (i.e., a spatial\nBEV image and an intensity BEV image). An end-to-end multi-BEV fusion network\nis designed to extract uniform features, equipping UniLGL with spatial and\nmaterial uniformity. To ensure robust LGL across heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, a\nviewpoint invariance hypothesis is introduced, which replaces the conventional\ntranslation equivariance assumption commonly used in existing LPR networks and\nsupervises UniLGL to achieve sensor-type uniformity in both global descriptors\nand local feature representations. Finally, based on the mapping between local\nfeatures on the 2D BEV image and the point cloud, a robust global pose\nestimator is derived that determines the global minimum of the global pose on\nSE(3) without requiring additional registration. To validate the effectiveness\nof the proposed uniform LGL, extensive benchmarks are conducted in real-world\nenvironments, and the results show that the proposed UniLGL is demonstratively\ncompetitive compared to other State-of-the-Art LGL methods. Furthermore, UniLGL\nhas been deployed on diverse platforms, including full-size trucks and agile\nMicro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), to enable high-precision localization and mapping\nas well as multi-MAV collaborative exploration in port and forest environments,\ndemonstrating the applicability of UniLGL in industrial and field scenarios."}

To address this, we\nintroduce Hybrid Prediction-based Risk-Aware Planning (HyPRAP), a\nprediction-based risk-aware path-planning framework which uses a hybrid\ncombination of models to predict local obstacle movement. HyPRAP uses a novel\nPrediction-based Collision Risk Index (P-CRI) to evaluate the risk posed by\neach obstacle, enabling the selective use of predictors based on whether the\nagent prioritizes high predictive accuracy or low computational prediction\noverhead. This selective routing enables the agent to focus on high-risk\nobstacles while ignoring or simplifying low-risk ones, making it suitable for\nenvironments with a large number of obstacles. Moreover, HyPRAP incorporates\nuncertainty quantification through hybrid conformal prediction by deriving\nconfidence bounds simultaneously achieved by multiple predictions across\ndifferent models.
