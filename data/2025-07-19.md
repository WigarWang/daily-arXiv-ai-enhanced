### [1] [Model Predictive Black Start for Dynamic Formation of DER-Led Microgrids with Inrush Current Impacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12569)
*Cong Bai,Salish Maharjan,Zhaoyu Wang*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合涌流可行性模块的模型预测黑启动（MPBS）框架，用于动态生成实时可行且最优的恢复序列，提升分布式资源主导的黑启动效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分布式能源渗透率下，配电网黑启动需先进控制框架以确保安全高效恢复。

Method: 利用DER输出和输电电网可用性的短期预测构建自适应启动路径，开发涌流可行性模块和电压控制策略。

Result: 涌流模型估计准确率超90%，MPBS框架避免了保护设备误操作并提升恢复效率。

Conclusion: MPBS框架在DER主导的黑启动中显著提升恢复效率与安全性。

Abstract: Black start (BS) of the distribution system (DS) with high penetration of
distributed energy resources (DERs) requires advanced control frameworks to
ensure secure and efficient restoration. This paper proposes a model predictive
black start (MPBS) framework incorporating an inrush current feasibility module
to dynamically generate real-time feasible and optimal restoration sequences.
Short-term forecasts of DER output and transmission grid (TG) availability are
utilized to construct adaptive cranking paths. The inrush current feasibility
module analytically estimates the transient inrush current caused by energizing
no-load distribution transformers (DTs). To mitigate excessive inrush current
and avoid potential misoperations of protection devices, an emergency
operation-inspired voltage control strategy and a switch blocking mechanism are
developed. The proposed inrush model is validated against electromagnetic
transient (EMT) simulations in PowerFactory with estimation accuracies
exceeding 90 %. Case studies on a modified IEEE 123-node feeder demonstrate
that the MPBS framework prevents misoperations of fuses and reclosers, reduces
unnecessary DER energy consumption, and enhances load restoration efficiency
during DER-led BS processes.

Conclusion: 该方法在车辆动力学建模与控制中表现出色，验证了深度Koopman框架和CER模块在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate modeling and control of autonomous vehicles remain a fundamental
challenge due to the nonlinear and coupled nature of vehicle dynamics. While
Koopman operator theory offers a framework for deploying powerful linear
control techniques, learning a finite-dimensional invariant subspace for
high-fidelity modeling continues to be an open problem. This paper presents a
deep Koopman approach for modeling and control of vehicle dynamics within the
curvilinear Frenet frame. The proposed framework uses a deep neural network
architecture to simultaneously learn the Koopman operator and its associated
invariant subspace from the data. Input-state bilinear interactions are
captured by the algorithm while preserving convexity, which makes it suitable
for real-time model predictive control (MPC) application. A multi-step
prediction loss is utilized during training to ensure long-horizon prediction
capability. To further enhance real-time trajectory tracking performance, the
model is integrated with a cumulative error regulator (CER) module, which
compensates for model mismatch by mitigating accumulated prediction errors.
Closed-loop performance is evaluated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
experiments using a CarSim RT model as the target plant, with real-time
validation conducted on a dSPACE SCALEXIO system. The proposed controller
achieved significant reductions in tracking error relative to baseline
controllers, confirming its suitability for real-time implementation in
embedded autonomous vehicle systems.

Abstract: Demand charge often constitutes a significant portion of electricity costs
for commercial electric vehicle charging station operators. This paper explores
control methods to reduce peak power consumption at workplace EV charging
stations in a joint price and power optimization framework. We optimize a menu
of price options to incentivize users to select controllable charging service.
Using this framework, we propose several solutions to achieve a reduction in
both demand charge and overall operator costs. Through a Monte Carlo

model is demonstrated to be effective in load control, helping the aggregator
to meet the target reduction while the consumers pay cheaper electricity bill.

### [5] [On the Properties of Optimal-Decay Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12717)
*Pio Ong,Max H. Cohen,Tamas G. Molnar,Aaron D. Ames*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了最优衰减控制屏障函数（OD-CBFs），通过自动调整衰减参数ω，改进了传统CBF不等式，并验证了其有效性、安全性和控制性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的控制屏障函数（CBF）中，用户定义的α函数对系统行为影响显著，但选择α缺乏系统化方法。本文旨在通过OD-CBFs自动化这一选择过程。

Method: 提出OD-CBFs框架，修改CBF不等式为带可调参数ω的形式，并验证其理论性质，包括有效性、控制不变性和前向不变性。

Result: OD-CBFs不仅保留了传统CBF的安全性，还能自动优化衰减参数，适用于高阶CBF和相对度为零的安全约束。仿真实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: OD-CBFs为安全控制器设计提供了系统化和自动化的方法，显著提升了CBF的适用性和性能。

Abstract: Control barrier functions provide a powerful means for synthesizing safety
filters that ensure safety framed as forward set invariance. Key to CBFs'
effectiveness is the simple inequality on the system dynamics: $\dot{h} \geq -
\alpha(h)$. Yet determining the class $\mathcal{K}^e$ function $\alpha$ is a
user defined choice that can have a dramatic effect on the resulting system
behavior. This paper formalizes the process of choosing $\alpha$ using
optimal-decay control barrier functions (OD-CBFs). These modify the traditional
CBF inequality to: $\dot{h} \geq - \omega \alpha(h)$, where $\omega \geq 0$ is
automatically determined by the safety filter. A comprehensive characterization
of this framework is elaborated, including tractable conditions on OD-CBF
validity, control invariance of the underlying sets in the state space, forward
invariance conditions for safe sets, and discussion on optimization-based safe
controllers in terms of their feasibility, Lipschitz continuity, and
closed-form expressions. The framework also extends existing higher-order CBF
techniques, addressing safety constraints with vanishing relative degrees. The
proposed method is demonstrated on a satellite control problem in simulation.

### [6] [Invariance Guarantees using Continuously Parametrized Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12743)
*Inkyu Jang,H. Jin Kim*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于参数化控制屏障函数（PCBF）的安全控制框架，通过动态选择参数来简化复杂空间中的不变集构造问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂或大规模空间中构造控制不变集的困难问题，传统方法需要合成复杂的CBF来匹配整个自由空间。

Method: 利用PCBF，每个参数对应一个简单形状的不变集，通过动态选择参数并通过二次规划（QP）设计轻量级反馈控制器PCBF-QP。

Result: 理论分析和仿真验证表明PCBF-QP能有效适应多样环境，且无需合成复杂CBF。

Conclusion: PCBF为复杂空间中的安全控制提供了更灵活和轻量的解决方案，并可扩展到高阶CBF。

Abstract: Constructing a control invariant set with an appropriate shape that fits
within a given state constraint is a fundamental problem in safety-critical
control but is known to be difficult, especially for large or complex spaces.
This paper introduces a safe control framework of utilizing PCBF: continuously
parametrized control barrier functions (CBFs). In PCBF, each choice of
parameter corresponds to a control invariant set of relatively simple shape.
Invariance-preserving control is done by dynamically selecting a parameter
whose corresponding invariant set lies within the safety bound. This eliminates
the need for synthesizing a single complex CBF that matches the entire free
space. It also enables easier adaptation to diverse environments. By assigning
a differentiable dynamics on the parameter space, we derive a lightweight
feedback controller based on quadratic programming (QP), namely PCBF-QP. We
also discuss on how to build a valid PCBF for a class of systems and how to
constrain the parameter so that the invariant set does not exceed the safety
bound. The concept is also extended to cover continuously parametrized
high-order CBFs, which is called high-order PCBF. Finally, simulation
experiments are conducted to validate the proposed approach.

### [7] [Latency-Optimal File Assignment in Geo-Distributed Storage with Preferential Demands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12830)
*Srivathsa Acharya,P. Vijay Kumar,Viveck R. Cadambe*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在具有通信延迟的地理分布式服务器网络中，如何最优地放置文件以最小化最坏情况延迟和系统平均延迟，特别关注了非均匀文件需求概率的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究假设文件需求是等概率的，而实际中需求往往是非均匀的，因此需要针对这种情况提出更优的文件放置策略。

Method: 首先将最坏情况延迟约束建模为顶点着色问题，然后将系统平均延迟优化转化为平衡分配问题，提出了一种在无编码方案中最优的方法。

Result: 提出的方案在无编码方案家族中是最优的，能够有效处理非均匀文件需求概率的场景。

Conclusion: 通过建模和优化方法，本文为地理分布式网络中的文件存储提供了适应非均匀需求的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of data storage in a geographically distributed (or
geo-distributed) network of servers (or nodes) where inter-node communication
incurs certain round-trip delays. Every node serves a set of users who can
request any file in the network. If the requested file is not available at the
node, it communicates with other nodes to obtain the file, thus causing the
user to experience latency in obtaining the file. The files can be placed
uncoded, where each node stores exact copies of the files, or in coded fashion,
where certain linear combination of files are placed at each node. We aim to
obtain an optimal file placement on the nodes with respect to minimizing the
worst-case latency at each node, as well as the system-average latency. The
prior literature considered the case of equiprobable file demands at the nodes.
In this paper, we investigate the generic case of non-uniform file-demand
probabilities at each node. The scheme presented here is optimal within the
family of uncoded schemes. It is obtained first by modeling the worst-case
latency constraint as a vertex coloring problem, and then converting the
system-average latency optimization to a problem of balanced-assignment.

### [8] [Guaranteeing and Explaining Stability across Heterogeneous Load Balancing using Calculus Network Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12892)
*Mengbang Zou,Yun Tang,Adolfo Perrusquía,Weisi Guo*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于微积分动力学空间的方法，用于分析基站间负载均衡中的振荡现象，并提供了同步条件和收敛保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的基站负载均衡算法在处理大规模基站网络时会出现振荡现象，且缺乏理论框架来解释和优化这一现象。

Method: 将异构的数据驱动算法抽象到微积分动力学空间，结合非保守误差和网络动态特征值谱分析，调整负载均衡机制。

Result: 通过该方法，可以高效实现负载均衡并保证收敛，或在无法满足同步条件时缓解振荡。

Conclusion: 论文提供了一种理论框架，能够解释负载均衡中的振荡现象，并优化算法以提高效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Load balancing between base stations (BSs) allows BS capacity to be
efficiently utilised and avoid outages. Currently, data-driven mechanisms
strive to balance inter-BS load and reduce unnecessary handovers. The challenge
is that over a large number of BSs, networks observe an oscillatory effect of
load evolution that causes high inter-BS messaging. Without a calculus function
that integrates network topology to describe the evolution of load states,
current data-driven algorithms cannot explain the oscillation phenomenon
observed in load states, nor can they provide theoretical guarantees on the
stability of the ideal synchronised state. Whilst we know load state
oscillation is coupled with the load balancing process algorithms and the
topology structure of inter-BS boundary relations, we do not have a theoretical
framework to prove this and a pathway to improving load balancing algorithms.
Here, we abstract generic and heterogeneous data-driven algorithms into a
calculus dynamics space, so that we can establish the synchronization
conditions for networked load balancing dynamics with any network topology. By
incorporating what is known as "non-conservative error" and the eigenvalue
spectrum of the networked dynamics, we can adjust the inter-BS load balancing
mechanisms to achieve high efficiency and convergence guarantee, or to mitigate
the oscillation when the synchronisation condition cannot be satisfied.

### [9] [Learning-Based Cost-Aware Defense of Parallel Server Systems against Malicious Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12975)
*Yuzhen Zhan,Li Jin*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用于并行服务器系统的网络-物理安全防御策略学习算法，结合零和马尔科夫安全博弈，提出了一种高效的近似极小极大Q学习算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究并行服务器系统的网络-物理安全问题，因其在工程应用中的重要性及易受攻击的脆弱性，如拒绝服务、数据篡改等。

Method: 开发了一种基于线性函数逼近的近似极小极大Q学习算法，计算博弈的均衡点，并结合Lyapunov方法和微分方程分析证明算法收敛性。

Result: 算法在模拟中收敛速度比基于神经网络的方法快约50倍，且最优性差距仅为4%—8%。

Conclusion: 算法在保证防御成本与性能平衡的同时，显著提升了计算效率，适用于复杂并行服务器系统。

Abstract: We consider the cyber-physical security of parallel server systems, which is
relevant for a variety of engineering applications such as networking,
manufacturing, and transportation. These systems rely on feedback control and
may thus be vulnerable to malicious attacks such as denial-of-service, data
falsification, and instruction manipulations. In this paper, we develop a
learning algorithm that computes a defensive strategy to balance technological
cost for defensive actions and performance degradation due to cyber attacks as
mentioned above. We consider a zero-sum Markov security game. We develop an
approximate minimax-Q learning algorithm that efficiently computes the
equilibrium of the game, and thus a cost-aware defensive strategy. The
algorithm uses interpretable linear function approximation tailored to the
system structure. We show that, under mild assumptions, the algorithm converges
with probability one to an approximate Markov perfect equilibrium. We first use
a Lyapunov method to address the unbounded temporal-difference error due to the
unbounded state space. We then use an ordinary differential equation-based
argument to establish convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that our
algorithm converges about 50 times faster than a representative neural
network-based method, with an insignificant optimality gap between 4\%--8\%,
depending on the complexity of the linear approximator and the number of
parallel servers.

### [10] [Fractional-order controller tuning via minimization of integral of time-weighted absolute error without multiple closed-loop tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12987)
*Ansei Yonezawa,Heisei Yonezawa,Shuichi Yahagi,Itsuro Kajiwara,Shinya Kijimoto*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于ITAE准则的非迭代调参技术，用于线性分数阶控制器的优化，避免了传统方法中需要多次闭环实验的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ITAE调参方法需要多次闭环实验或模型仿真，增加了开发成本。本研究旨在减少实验次数，降低分数阶控制器的开发复杂度。

Method: 通过收集一次输入/输出数据，定义虚拟参考信号，重新形式化ITAE最小化问题，直接求解最优控制器参数。

Result: 数值研究验证了该方法的有效性，显著减少了实验次数和开发成本。

Conclusion: 该技术为分数阶控制器的实际应用提供了更高效和经济的解决方案。

Abstract: This study presents a non-iterative tuning technique for a linear
fractional-order (FO) controller, based on the integral of the time-weighted
absolute error (ITAE) criterion. Minimizing the ITAE is a traditional approach
for tuning FO controllers. This technique reduces the over/undershoot and
suppresses the steady-state error. In contrast to conventional approaches of
ITAE-based controller tuning, the proposed approach does not require multiple
closed-loop experiments or model-based simulations to evaluate the ITAE. The
one-shot input/output data is collected from the controlled plant. A fictitious
reference signal is defined on the basis of the collected input and output
signal, which enables us to evaluate the closed-loop response provided by the
arbitrary controller parameters. To avoid repeated experiments that are
necessary in the conventional approach, we reformulate the ITAE minimization
problem using the fictitious reference signal. The desired FO controller
parameters minimizing the ITAE are obtained by solving the optimization problem
that is based on the fictitious reference signal. The validity of the proposed
approach is demonstrated by a numerical study. The avoidance of repeated
experiments significantly reduces the development cost of linear FO
controllers, thereby facilitating their practical application.

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法在振动抑制方面优于现有控制器，提升了乘坐舒适度。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来高速磁悬浮车辆提供了一种有效的控制解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents a novel Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategy
for high-speed Maglev vehicles that explicitly incorporates mechanical
suspension dynamics into the control model. Unlike conventional approaches,
which often neglect the interaction between levitation magnet and car body
motion, the proposed method enables predictive vibration mitigation by modeling
both electromagnetic forces and suspension behavior. This integrated approach
significantly improves passenger comfort and ride quality by reducing vertical
oscillations caused by track irregularities. Moreover, it allows for a more
effective tuning of the trade-off between precise air gap tracking and ride
comfort. Simulations based on a detailed multibody model of the Transrapid
demonstrate that the method outperforms existing controllers in vibration
suppression, making it a promising solution for future high-speed Maglev
applications.

### [12] [Dual LiDAR-Based Traffic Movement Count Estimation at a Signalized Intersection: Deployment, Data Collection, and Preliminary Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13073)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TMC方法（如相机识别）在恶劣天气和夜间效果不佳，而LiDAR技术成本降低且在3D物体检测中应用广泛，因此作者尝试使用双LiDAR系统提高TMC的准确性和可靠性。

Result: 展示了TMC的估计结果，分析了观察到的趋势和不规则性，证明了双LiDAR系统的有效性。

Conclusion: 双LiDAR系统有效改进了TMC估计，并具有进一步优化轨迹预测和意图识别的潜力。

Abstract: Traffic Movement Count (TMC) at intersections is crucial for optimizing
signal timings, assessing the performance of existing traffic control measures,
and proposing efficient lane configurations to minimize delays, reduce
congestion, and promote safety. Traditionally, methods such as manual counting,
loop detectors, pneumatic road tubes, and camera-based recognition have been
used for TMC estimation. Although generally reliable, camera-based TMC
estimation is prone to inaccuracies under poor lighting conditions during harsh
weather and nighttime. In contrast, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
technology is gaining popularity in recent times due to reduced costs and its
expanding use in 3D object detection, tracking, and related applications. This
paper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a
dual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC
estimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to
classify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and
vehicle classes. This work discusses the estimated TMC results and provides
insights into the observed trends and irregularities. Potential improvements
are also discussed that could enhance not only TMC estimation, but also
trajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections.

Conclusion: 通过多级非地面网络和优化算法，有效改善了医疗物联网任务卸载的延迟性能。

Abstract: In this work, we consider the resource allocation problem for task offloading
from Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, to a non-terrestrial network.
The architecture considers clusters of IoMT devices that offload their tasks to
a dedicated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) serving as a multi-access edge
computing (MEC) server, which can compute the task or further offload it to an
available high-altitude platform station (HAPS) or to a low-earth orbit (LEO)
satellite for remote computing. We formulate a problem that has as objective
the minimization of the weighted sum delay of the tasks. Given the non-convex
nature of the problem, and acknowledging that the complexity of the
optimization algorithms impact their performance, we derive a low-complexity
joint subchannel allocation and offloading decision algorithm with dynamic
computing resource initialization, developed as a greedy heuristic based on
convex optimization criteria. Simulations show the gain obtained by including
the different non-terrestrial nodes against architectures without them.

Result: 在IEEE 39总线系统（70%逆变器资源渗透率）中验证，该方法避免了系统崩溃，保障了频率稳定性，成本仅增加5%。

Conclusion: 该框架在高逆变器资源渗透电网中有效防止了系统崩溃，提升了暂态稳定性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework to address the critical loss of transient
stability caused by reduced inertia in grids with high inverter-based resource
(IBR) penetration. The proposed method integrates a predictive deep learning
(DL) model with information gap decision theory (IGDT) to create a risk-averse
dispatch strategy. By reformulating the conventional virtual inertia scheduling
(VIS) problem, the framework uses early predictions of post-fault dynamics to
proactively redispatch resources, ensuring the system's center of inertia
remains stable under worst-case contingencies. Validated on the IEEE 39-bus
system with 70% IBR penetration, the proposed approach prevents system collapse
where a conventional VIS strategy fails, ensuring frequency stability at a cost
increase of only 5%.

### [15] [Privacy-Preserving Fusion for Multi-Sensor Systems Under Multiple Packet Dropouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13286)

Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are critical components in modern
cyber-physical systems, enabling efficient data collection and fusion through
spatially distributed sensors. However, the inherent risks of eavesdropping and
packet dropouts in such networks pose significant challenges to secure state
estimation. In this paper, we address the privacy-preserving fusion estimation
(PPFE) problem for multi-sensor systems under multiple packet dropouts and
eavesdropping attacks. To mitigate these issues, we propose a distributed
encoding-based privacy-preserving mechanism (PPM) within a control-theoretic
framework, ensuring data privacy during transmission while maintaining the
performance of legitimate state estimation. A centralized fusion filter is
developed, accounting for the coupling effects of packet dropouts and the
encoding-based PPM. Boundedness conditions for the legitimate user's estimation
error covariance are derived via a modified algebraic Riccati equation.
Additionally, by demonstrating the divergence of the eavesdropper's mean
estimation error, the proposed PPFE algorithm's data confidentiality is
rigorously analyzed. Simulation results for an Internet-based three-tank system
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, highlighting its potential
to enhance privacy without compromising estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: 该研究不仅扩展了Ballantine的结果，还通过最优质量输运理论提供了新的工具，强调了这一方法在多领域的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: The present work revisits and provides a new approach on a result by Charles
Ballantine, on the factorization of a square matrix with positive determinant
into a product of positive definite factors. {\em Ballantine-type}
factorizations, that bound the number of positive definite factors, proved
central in solving a basic, yet elusive control problem--the strong
controllability of a linear system via control in the form of state feedback.
Ballantine's result transcends control engineering, and highlights the little
appreciated fact that rotations can be realized by the successive application
of irrotational motions. Our approach is constructive and is based on the
theory of optimal mass transport, specifically, it relates successive rotations
of Gaussian distributions to corresponding optimal transport maps that

Conclusion: 提出的二阶最优条件更具普适性，为非凸优化问题提供了新工具。

Abstract: This paper explores local second-order weak sharp minima for a broad class of
nonconvex optimization problems. We propose novel second-order optimality
conditions formulated through the use of classical and lower generalized
support functions. These results are based on asymptotic second-order tangent
cones and outer second-order tangent sets. Specifically, our findings eliminate
the necessity of assuming convexity in the constraint set and/or the outer
second-order tangent set, or the nonemptiness of the outer second-order tangent
set. Furthermore, unlike traditional approaches, our sufficient conditions do
not rely on strong assumptions such as the uniform second-order regularity of
the constraint set and the property of uniform approximation of the critical
cones.

Abstract: This paper studies an open consensus network design problem: identifying the
optimal simple directed graphs, given a fixed number of vertices and arcs, that
maximize the second smallest real part of all Laplacian eigenvalues, referred
to as algebraic connectivity. For sparse and dense graphs, the class of all
optimal directed graphs that maximize algebraic connectivity is theoretically
identified, leading to the fastest consensus. For general graphs, a
computationally efficient sequence of almost regular directed graphs is
proposed to achieve fast consensus, with algebraic connectivity close to the
optimal value.

Abstract: The $\star_M$-family of tensor-tensor products is a framework which
generalizes many properties from linear algebra to third order tensors. Here,
we investigate positive semidefiniteness and semidefinite programming under the
$\star_M$-product. Critical to our investigation is a connection between the
choice of matrix M in the $\star_M$-product and the representation theory of an
underlying group action. Using this framework, third order tensors equipped
with the $\star_M$-product are a natural setting for the study of invariant
semidefinite programs. As applications of the M-SDP framework, we provide a
characterization of certain nonnegative quadratic forms and solve low-rank
tensor completion problems.

Abstract: We consider the multilinear polytope defined as the convex hull of the
feasible region of a linearized binary polynomial optimization problem. We
define a relaxation in an extended space for this polytope, which we refer to
as the complete edge relaxation. The complete edge relaxation is stronger than
several well-known relaxations of the multilinear polytope, including the
standard linearization, the flower relaxation, and the intersection of all
possible recursive McCormick relaxations. We prove that the complete edge
relaxation is an extension of the multilinear polytope if and only if the
corresponding hypergraph is alpha-acyclic; i.e., the most general type of
hypergraph acyclicity. This is in stark contrast with the widely-used standard
linearization which describes the multilinear polytope if and only if the
hypergraph is Berge-acyclic; i.e., the most restrictive type of hypergraph
acyclicity. We then introduce a new class of facet-defining inequalities for
the multilinear polytope of alpha-cycles of length three, which serve as the
generalization of the well-known triangle inequalities for the Boolean quadric
polytope.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动汽车市场份额的增长，无序充电可能导致电网峰值需求增加，因此需要智能充电调度和V2G技术来缓解电网压力。

Method: 采用混合整数线性规划方法，考虑EV充电需求、位置变动和局部电力需求，优化充电调度以降低成本。

Result: 在极端电力容量约束下，EV充电成本仅受到轻微影响。

Conclusion: 智能充电调度和V2G技术可以有效减少充电成本和电网压力，尤其是在电力容量受限的情况下。

Abstract: The growth in Electric Vehicle (EV) market share is expected to increase
power demand on distribution networks. Uncoordinated residential EV charging,
based on driving routines, creates peak demand at various zone substations
depending on location and time. Leveraging smart charge scheduling and
Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technologies offers opportunities to adjust charge
schedules, allowing for load shifting and grid support, which can reduce both
charging costs and grid stress. In this work, we develop a charge scheduling
optimization method that can be used to assess the impact of spatial power
capacity constraints and real-time price profiles. We formulate a mixed-integer
linear programming problem to minimize overall charging costs, taking into
account factors such as time-varying EV locations, EV charging requirements,
and local power demands across different zones. Our analysis uses real data for
pricing signals and local power demands, combined with simulated data for EV
driving plans. Four metrics are introduced to assess impacts from the
perspectives of both EV users and zones. Results indicate that overall EV
charging costs are only minimally affected under extreme power capacity
constraints.

Result: 框架支持非光滑Lyapunov方法和哈密顿稳定性准则，简化系统分析同时忠实反映原始动态结构。

Conclusion: 方法实用性强，通过多个示例验证了其有效性和适用范围。

Abstract: This paper develops a geometric framework for the stability analysis of
differential inclusions governed by maximally monotone operators. A key
structural decomposition expresses the operator as the sum of a convexified
limit mapping and a normal cone. However, the resulting dynamics are often
difficult to analyze directly due to the absence of Lipschitz selections and
boundedness. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a regularized system
based on a fixed Lipschitz approximation of the convexified mapping. From this
approximation, we extract a single-valued Lipschitz selection that preserves
the essential geometric features of the original system. This framework enables
the application of nonsmooth Lyapunov methods and Hamiltonian-based stability
criteria. Instead of approximating trajectories, we focus on analyzing a
simplified system that faithfully reflects the structure of the original
dynamics. Several examples are provided to illustrate the method's practicality
and scope.

Conclusion: 所提SCRN方法在梯度易估计、Hessian昂贵的问题中高效且性能优越。

Abstract: Cubic regularized Newton (CRN) methods have attracted signiffcant research
interest because they offer stronger solution guarantees and lower iteration
complexity. With the rise of the big-data era, there is growing interest in
developing stochastic cubic regularized Newton (SCRN) methods that do not
require exact gradient and Hessian evaluations. In this paper, we propose
faster SCRN methods that incorporate gradient estimation with small, controlled
errors and Hessian estimation with momentum-based variance reduction. These
methods are particularly effective for problems where the gradient can be
estimated accurately and at low cost, whereas accurate estimation of the
Hessian is expensive. Under mild assumptions, we establish the iteration
complexity of our SCRN methods by analyzing the descent of a novel potential
sequence. Finally, numerical experiments show that our SCRN methods can achieve
comparable performance to deterministic CRN methods and vastly outperform
ffrst-order methods in terms of both iteration counts and solution quality.

Conclusion: LDM-NPSTM是一种有效的分类器，尤其适用于高维数据分类任务。

Abstract: Based on the tensor-based large margin distribution and the nonparallel
support tensor machine, we establish a novel classifier for binary
classification problem in this paper, termed the Large Margin Distribution
based NonParallel Support Tensor Machine (LDM-NPSTM). The proposed classifier
has the following advantages: First, it utilizes tensor data as training
samples, which helps to comprehensively preserve the inherent structural
information of high-dimensional data, thereby improving classification
accuracy. Second, this classifier not only considers traditional empirical risk
and structural risk but also incorporates the marginal distribution information
of the samples, further enhancing its classification performance. To solve this
classifier, we use alternative projection algorithm. Specifically, building on
the formulation where in the proposed LDM-NPSTM, the parameters defining the
separating hyperplane form a tensor (tensorplane) constrained to be the sum of
rank-one tensors, the corresponding optimization problem is solved iteratively
using alternative projection algorithm. In each iteration, the parameters
related to the projections along a single tensor mode are estimated by solving
a typical Support Vector Machine-type optimization problem. Finally, the
efficiency and performance of the proposed model and algorithm are verified
through theoretical analysis and some numerical examples.

Conclusion: 该方法为无监督度量学习提供了新的算法和建模思路，扩展了可用的距离度量选择。

Abstract: Data classification without access to labeled samples remains a challenging
problem. It usually depends on an appropriately chosen distance between
features, a topic addressed in metric learning. Recently, Huizing, Cantini and
Peyr\'e proposed to simultaneously learn optimal transport (OT) cost matrices
between samples and features of the dataset. This leads to the task of finding
positive eigenvectors of a certain nonlinear function that maps cost matrices
to OT distances. Having this basic idea in mind, we consider both the
algorithmic and the modeling part of unsupervised metric learning. First, we
examine appropriate algorithms and their convergence. In particular, we propose
to use the stochastic random function iteration algorithm and prove that it
converges linearly for our setting, although our operators are not
paracontractive as it was required for convergence so far. Second, we ask the
natural question if the OT distance can be replaced by other distances. We show
how Mahalanobis-like distances fit into our considerations. Further, we examine
an approach via graph Laplacians. In contrast to the previous settings, we have
just to deal with linear functions in the wanted matrices here, so that simple
algorithms from linear algebra can be applied.

Motivation: 由于深度学习模型中观察到重尾梯度噪声，现有研究对弱凸目标下的收敛性理解不足，因此填补这一空白。

Method: 针对子Weibull噪声分析普通随机次梯度下降法（SsGD）的高概率收敛；针对p-BCM噪声分析裁剪SsGD的高概率和期望收敛。

Result: 弱凸目标的非光滑性和非凸性不影响收敛性依赖关系，但p-BCM噪声下的样本复杂度劣于已知下界。

Conclusion: 研究填补了在重尾噪声下SFOMs的收敛性理论空白，为弱凸优化提供了新的分析框架。

Abstract: An increasing number of studies have focused on stochastic first-order
methods (SFOMs) under heavy-tailed gradient noises, which have been observed in
the training of practical deep learning models. In this paper, we focus on two
types of gradient noises: one is sub-Weibull noise, and the other is noise
under the assumption that it has a bounded $p$-th central moment ($p$-BCM) with
$p\in (1, 2]$. The latter is more challenging due to the occurrence of infinite
variance when $p\in (1, 2)$. Under these two gradient noise assumptions, the
in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs have been extensively
studied in the contexts of convex optimization and standard smooth
optimization. However, for weakly convex objectives-a class that includes all
Lipschitz-continuous convex objectives and smooth objectives-our understanding
of the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs under these two
types of noises remains incomplete. We investigate the high-probability
convergence of the vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) method under
sub-Weibull noises, as well as the high-probability and in-expectation
convergence of clipped SsGD under the $p$-BCM noises. Both analyses are
conducted in the context of weakly convex optimization. For weakly convex
objectives that may be non-convex and non-smooth, our results demonstrate that
the theoretical dependence of vanilla SsGD on the failure probability and
number of iterations under sub-Weibull noises does not degrade compared to the
case of smooth objectives. Under $p$-BCM noises, our findings indicate that the
non-smoothness and non-convexity of weakly convex objectives do not impact the
theoretical dependence of clipped SGD on the failure probability relative to
the smooth case; however, the sample complexity we derived is worse than a
well-known lower bound for smooth optimization.

Abstract: Methods for Novel View Synthesis (NVS) have recently found traction in the
field of LiDAR simulation and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction. While
solutions for faster rendering or handling dynamic scenes have been proposed,
LiDAR specific effects remain insufficiently addressed. By explicitly modeling
sensor characteristics such as rolling shutter, laser power variations, and
intensity falloff, our method achieves more accurate LiDAR simulation compared
to existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods,
as well as ablation studies that highlight the importance of each sensor model
component. Beyond that, we show that our approach exhibits advanced
resimulation capabilities, such as generating high resolution LiDAR scans in
the camera perspective.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) and World Models (WMs) offer complementary strengths
in task generalization at different levels. In this work, we propose FOUNDER, a
framework that integrates the generalizable knowledge embedded in FMs with the
dynamic modeling capabilities of WMs to enable open-ended task solving in
embodied environments in a reward-free manner. We learn a mapping function that
grounds FM representations in the WM state space, effectively inferring the
agent's physical states in the world simulator from external observations. This
mapping enables the learning of a goal-conditioned policy through imagination
during behavior learning, with the mapped task serving as the goal state. Our
method leverages the predicted temporal distance to the goal state as an
informative reward signal. FOUNDER demonstrates superior performance on various
multi-task offline visual control benchmarks, excelling in capturing the
deep-level semantics of tasks specified by text or videos, particularly in
scenarios involving complex observations or domain gaps where prior methods
struggle. The consistency of our learned reward function with the ground-truth

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出ReAL-AD框架，基于人类认知模型，结合视觉语言模型增强自动驾驶的决策和规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶方法因固定稀疏监督限制了人类层次的推理能力。

Method: 采用三层次认知模型（策略、决策、操作），结合VLMs实现结构化推理。

Result: 规划准确率和安全性提升30%以上。

Conclusion: ReAL-AD使自动驾驶更可解释且接近人类推理。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising approach to unify
perception, prediction, and planning within a single framework, reducing
information loss and improving adaptability. However, existing methods often
rely on fixed and sparse trajectory supervision, limiting their ability to
capture the hierarchical reasoning process that human drivers naturally employ.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReAL-AD, a Reasoning-Augmented Learning
framework that structures decision-making in autonomous driving based on the
three-tier human cognitive model: Driving Strategy, Driving Decision, and
Driving Operation, where Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are incorporated to
enhance situational awareness and structured reasoning across these levels.
Specifically, we introduce: (1) the Strategic Reasoning Injector, which
formulates high-level driving strategies by interpreting complex traffic
contexts from VLM-generated insights; (2) the Tactical Reasoning Integrator,
which refines strategic intent into interpretable tactical choices such as lane
changes, overtaking, and speed adjustments; and (3) the Hierarchical Trajectory
Decoder, which progressively translates tactical decisions into precise control
actions for smooth and human-like trajectory execution. Extensive evaluations
show that integrating our framework improves planning accuracy and safety by
over 30%, making end-to-end autonomous driving more interpretable and aligned
with human-like hierarchical reasoning. The project page can be found at:

Abstract: Tool design and use reflect the ability to understand and manipulate the
physical world through creativity, planning, and foresight. As such, these
capabilities are often regarded as measurable indicators of intelligence across
biological species. While much of today's research on robotic intelligence
focuses on generating better controllers, inventing smarter tools offers a
complementary form of physical intelligence: shifting the onus of
problem-solving onto the tool's design. Given the vast and impressive
common-sense, reasoning, and creative capabilities of today's foundation
models, we investigate whether these models can provide useful priors to
automatically design and effectively wield such tools? We present VLMgineer, a
framework that harnesses the code generation abilities of vision language
models (VLMs) together with evolutionary search to iteratively co-design
physical tools and the action plans that operate them to perform a task. We
evaluate VLMgineer on a diverse new benchmark of everyday manipulation
scenarios that demand creative tool design and use. Across this suite,
VLMgineer consistently discovers tools and policies that solve tasks more
effectively and innovatively, transforming challenging robotics problems into
straightforward executions. It also outperforms VLM-generated designs from
human specifications and existing human-crafted tools for everyday tasks. To
facilitate future research on automated tool invention, we will release our
benchmark and code.

Abstract: Soil moisture is a quantity of interest in many application areas including
agriculture and climate modeling. Existing methods are not suitable for scale
applications due to large deployment costs in high-resolution sensing
applications such as for variable irrigation. In this work, we design, build
and field deploy an autonomous mobile robot, MoistureMapper, for soil moisture
sensing. The robot is equipped with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors and
a direct push drill mechanism for deploying the sensor to measure volumetric
water content in the soil. Additionally, we implement and evaluate multiple
adaptive sampling strategies based on a Gaussian Process based modeling to
build a spatial mapping of moisture distribution in the soil. We present
results from large scale computational simulations and proof-of-concept
deployment on the field. The adaptive sampling approach outperforms a greedy
benchmark approach and results in up to 30\% reduction in travel distance and
5\% reduction in variance in the reconstructed moisture maps. Link to video

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人任务（如精准操作和感知）提供了新的稳定性评估手段，适用于农业和太空应用。

Abstract: Navigating in off-road environments for wheeled mobile robots is challenging
due to dynamic and rugged terrain. Traditional physics-based stability metrics,
such as Static Stability Margin (SSM) or Zero Moment Point (ZMP) require
knowledge of contact forces, terrain geometry, and the robot's precise
center-of-mass that are difficult to measure accurately in real-world field
conditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based approach to estimate
robot platform stability directly from proprioceptive data using a lightweight
neural network, IMUnet. Our method enables data-driven inference of robot
stability without requiring an explicit terrain model or force sensing.
  We also develop a novel vision-based ArUco tracking method to compute a
scalar score to quantify robot platform stability called C3 score. The score
captures image-space perturbations over time as a proxy for physical
instability and is used as a training signal for the neural network based
model. As a pilot study, we evaluate our approach on data collected across
multiple terrain types and speeds and demonstrate generalization to previously
unseen conditions. These initial results highlight the potential of using IMU
and robot velocity as inputs to estimate platform stability. The proposed
method finds application in gating robot tasks such as precision actuation and
sensing, especially for mobile manipulation tasks in agricultural and space
applications. Our learning method also provides a supervision mechanism for
perception based traversability estimation and planning.

Conclusion: 该方法在推理速度和分割性能间取得平衡，并在实际机器人平台上成功验证。

Abstract: With the rapid development of lightweight visual neural network
architectures, traditional high-performance vision models have undergone
significant compression, greatly improving their computational efficiency and
energy consumption ratio. This makes them feasible for deployment on
resource-constrained edge computing devices. We propose a visual-assisted
navigation framework called Atrous Strip Convolution-Sliding Window (ASC-SW),
which leverages a depth camera and a lightweight visual neural network to
assist map-based mobile robot navigation. This framework compensates for the
inability of traditional light detection and range (LiDAR) sensors to detect
ground-level obstacles such as ground-level wires. We introduce a lightweight
and efficient segmentation model, Atrous Strip Convolution Network (ASCnet),
for detecting deformable linear objects (DLOs). MobileNetV2 is used as the
backbone network, and Atrous Strip Convolution Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASCSPP)
is designed to extract DLO features more effectively. Atrous Strip Convolution
is integrated into ASCSPP to accurately identify the linear structure of DLOs
with low computational cost. Additionally, a Sliding Window (SW)
post-processing module is proposed to denoise the output in complex
environments, improving recognition accuracy. Our method strikes a balance
between inference speed and segmentation performance. It achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (Miou) score of 75.3% on a self-built dataset and
reaches 9.3 FPS inference speed on the Jetson Orin Nano edge device. Overall,
our approach outperforms existing DLO detection models and has been
successfully validated on a physical robotic platform.

Result: 优化步态参数显著降低了能量消耗，提高了四足机器人的运动效率。

Conclusion: 这项工作为四足机器人的能量高效控制策略提供了新见解，可直接应用于商业化平台。

Abstract: Energy efficiency is a critical factor in the performance and autonomy of
quadrupedal robots. While previous research has focused on mechanical design
and actuation improvements, the impact of gait parameters on energetics has
been less explored. In this paper, we hypothesize that gait parameters,
specifically duty factor, phase shift, and stride duration, are key
determinants of energy consumption in quadrupedal locomotion. To test this
hypothesis, we modeled the Unitree A1 quadrupedal robot and developed a
locomotion controller capable of independently adjusting these gait parameters.
Simulations of bounding gaits were conducted in Gazebo across a range of gait
parameters at three different speeds: low, medium, and high. Experimental tests
were also performed to validate the simulation results. The findings
demonstrate that optimizing gait parameters can lead to significant reductions
in energy consumption, enhancing the overall efficiency of quadrupedal
locomotion. This work contributes to the advancement of energy-efficient
control strategies for legged robots, offering insights directly applicable to
commercially available platforms.

Result: 实验表明，该系统在静态和动态物体查询中表现更优，路径更短，检索成功率更高。

Conclusion: 通过弱化高保真地图细节，强化环境上下文与语义推理，能显著改善动态环境下的导航效果。

Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary robot mapping methods enrich dense geometric maps with
pre-trained visual-language features, achieving a high level of detail and
guiding robots to find objects specified by open-vocabulary language queries.
While the issue of scalability for such approaches has received some attention,
another fundamental problem is that high-detail object mapping quickly becomes
outdated, as objects get moved around a lot. In this work, we develop a mapping
and navigation system for object-goal navigation that, from the ground up,
considers the possibilities that a queried object can have moved, or may not be
mapped at all. Instead of striving for high-fidelity mapping detail, we
consider that the main purpose of a map is to provide environment grounding and
context, which we combine with the semantic priors of LLMs to reason about
object locations and deploy an active, online approach to navigate to the
objects. Through simulated and real-world experiments we find that our approach
tends to have higher retrieval success at shorter path lengths for static
objects and by far outperforms prior approaches in cases of dynamic or unmapped
object queries. We provide our code and dataset at:

Abstract: Though visual and repeat navigation is a convenient solution for mobile robot
self-navigation, achieving balance between efficiency and robustness in task
environment still remains challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and repeat robotic autonomous navigation method that requires no accurate
localization and dense reconstruction modules, which makes our system featured
by lightweight and robustness. Firstly, feature flow is introduced and we
develop a qualitative mapping between feature flow and robot's motion, in which
feature flow is defined as pixel location bias between matched features. Based
on the mapping model, the map outputted by the teaching phase is represented as
a keyframe graph, in which the feature flow on the edge encodes the relative
motion between adjacent keyframes. Secondly, the visual repeating navigation is
essentially modeled as a feature flow minimization problem between current
observation and the map keyframe. To drive the robot to consistently reduce the
feature flow between current frame and map keyframes without accurate
localization, a probabilistic motion planning is developed based on our
qualitative feature flow-motion mapping indicator. Extensive experiments using
our mobile platform demonstrates that our proposed method is lightweight,
robust, and superior to baselines. The source code has been made public at
https://github.com/wangjks/FFI-VTR to benefit the community.

Abstract: As robots become increasingly capable of operating over extended periods --
spanning days, weeks, and even months -- they are expected to accumulate
knowledge of their environments and leverage this experience to assist humans
more effectively. This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied
Question Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past
experiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,
temporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically
focus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a
single past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,
present, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult
its memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.
Standard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to
limited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to
combine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a
structured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from
cognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based
world instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables
targeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the
exploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping
criteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information. We
evaluate our method on real-world experiments and introduce a new benchmark
that spans popular simulation environments and actual industrial sites. Our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding
substantial gains in both answer accuracy and exploration efficiency.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在控制系统中应用时，依赖精心设计的任务示例，且缺乏评估幻觉的方法，需要工程师参与设计复杂的优化问题。

Conclusion: DEMONSTRATE方法通过任务描述嵌入和多任务学习，有效解决了LLM在控制系统中依赖设计示例的问题，并提供了幻觉评估的可行方案。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with control systems has
demonstrated significant potential in various settings, such as task completion
with a robotic manipulator. A main reason for this success is the ability of
LLMs to perform in-context learning, which, however, strongly relies on the
design of task examples, closely related to the target tasks. Consequently,
employing LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task
examples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained
engineers. Furthermore, there is often no principled way to evaluate for
hallucination before task execution. To address these challenges, we propose
DEMONSTRATE, a novel methodology that avoids the use of LLMs for complex
optimization problem generations, and instead only relies on the embedding
representations of task descriptions. To do this, we leverage tools from
inverse optimal control to replace in-context prompt examples with task
demonstrations, as well as the concept of multitask learning, which ensures
target and example task similarity by construction. Given the fact that
hardware demonstrations can easily be collected using teleoperation or guidance
of the robot, our approach significantly reduces the reliance on engineering
expertise for designing in-context examples. Furthermore, the enforced
multitask structure enables learning from few demonstrations and assessment of
hallucinations prior to task execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method through simulation and hardware experiments involving a robotic arm
tasked with tabletop manipulation.

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了OOD条件下的情境感知和决策能力，有效缓解了脱节问题。

Conclusion: LaViPlan为自动驾驶中的VLM提供了一种有效的后训练优化范式，具有实际应用前景。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving refer to situations
that deviate from the training domain, often leading to unexpected and
potentially hazardous behavior from planners that lack prior exposure to such
cases. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into
autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in
OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD
scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn
right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between
the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and
the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we
propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics.
This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in
existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving
scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making
under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment
issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents
in the context of autonomous driving.

Result: MoCap2GT在实验中表现优于现有方法，显著提升了SLAM基准测试的精度。

Conclusion: MoCap2GT为SLAM评估提供了更精确的地面轨迹生成方法，推动了SLAM技术的进一步发展。

Abstract: Marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap) systems are widely used to
provide ground truth (GT) trajectories for benchmarking SLAM algorithms.
However, the accuracy of MoCap-based GT trajectories is mainly affected by two
factors: spatiotemporal calibration errors between the MoCap system and the
device under test (DUT), and inherent MoCap jitter. Consequently, existing
benchmarks focus primarily on absolute translation error, as accurate
assessment of rotation and inter-frame errors remains challenging, hindering
thorough SLAM evaluation. This paper proposes MoCap2GT, a joint optimization
approach that integrates MoCap data and inertial measurement unit (IMU)
measurements from the DUT for generating high-precision GT trajectories.
MoCap2GT includes a robust state initializer to ensure global convergence,
introduces a higher-order B-spline pose parameterization on the SE(3) manifold
with variable time offset to effectively model MoCap factors, and employs a
degeneracy-aware measurement rejection strategy to enhance estimation accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MoCap2GT outperforms existing methods and
significantly contributes to precise SLAM benchmarking. The source code is

Conclusion: 该方法为安全和有效的运动规划提供了通用解决方案，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Safe and effective motion planning is crucial for autonomous robots.
Diffusion models excel at capturing complex agent interactions, a fundamental
aspect of decision-making in dynamic environments. Recent studies have
successfully applied diffusion models to motion planning, demonstrating their
competence in handling complex scenarios and accurately predicting multi-modal
future trajectories. Despite their effectiveness, diffusion models have
limitations in training objectives, as they approximate data distributions
rather than explicitly capturing the underlying decision-making dynamics.
However, the crux of motion planning lies in non-differentiable downstream
objectives, such as safety (collision avoidance) and effectiveness
(goal-reaching), which conventional learning algorithms cannot directly
optimize. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based training
scheme for diffusion motion planning models, enabling them to effectively learn
non-differentiable objectives that explicitly measure safety and effectiveness.
Specifically, we introduce a reward-weighted dynamic thresholding algorithm to
shape a dense reward signal, facilitating more effective training and
outperforming models trained with differentiable objectives. State-of-the-art
performance on pedestrian datasets (CrowdNav, ETH-UCY) compared to various
baselines demonstrates the versatility of our approach for safe and effective
motion planning.

Abstract: AI-based robots and vehicles are expected to operate safely in complex and
dynamic environments, even in the presence of component degradation. In such
systems, perception relies on sensors such as cameras to capture environmental
data, which is then processed by AI models to support decision-making. However,
degradation in sensor performance directly impacts input data quality and can
impair AI inference. Specifying safety requirements for all possible sensor
degradation scenarios leads to unmanageable complexity and inevitable gaps. In
this position paper, we present a novel framework that integrates camera noise
factor identification with situation coverage analysis to systematically elicit
robustness-related safety requirements for AI-based perception systems. We
focus specifically on camera degradation in the automotive domain. Building on
an existing framework for identifying degradation modes, we propose involving
domain, sensor, and safety experts, and incorporating Operational Design Domain
specifications to extend the degradation model by incorporating noise factors
relevant to AI performance. Situation coverage analysis is then applied to
identify representative operational contexts. This work marks an initial step
toward integrating noise factor analysis and situational coverage to support
principled formulation and completeness assessment of robustness requirements
for camera-based AI perception.

Abstract: Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but
their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect
physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and
wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several
ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical
pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action
prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,
map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results
reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation
space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like
collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged
robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless
integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN
evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical
deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's
overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to
rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is

also increases the difficulty of designing MPC cost functions that reflect the
desired long-term objective. This paper proposes ZipMPC, a method that imitates
a long-horizon MPC behaviour by learning a compressed and context-dependent
cost function for a short-horizon MPC. It improves performance over alternative
methods, such as approximate explicit MPC and automatic cost parameter tuning,
in particular in terms of i) optimizing the long term objective; ii)
maintaining computational costs comparable to a short-horizon MPC; iii)
ensuring constraint satisfaction; and iv) generalizing control behaviour to
environments not observed during training. For this purpose, ZipMPC leverages
the concept of differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients
of the imitation loss through the MPC optimization. We validate our proposed
method in simulation and real-world experiments on autonomous racing. ZipMPC
consistently completes laps faster than selected baselines, achieving lap times
close to the long-horizon MPC baseline. In challenging scenarios where the
short-horizon MPC baseline fails to complete a lap, ZipMPC is able to do so. In
particular, these performance gains are also observed on tracks unseen during
training.

Conclusion: 需要跨学科合作，以建立一个更扎实且适应性强的信任框架，推动人类与机器人互动领域的发展。

Abstract: As robots find their way into more and more aspects of everyday life,
questions around trust are becoming increasingly important. What does it mean
to trust a robot? And how should we think about trust in relationships that
involve both humans and non-human agents? While the field of Human-Robot
Interaction (HRI) has made trust a central topic, the concept is often
approached in fragmented ways. At the same time, established work in sociology,
where trust has long been a key theme, is rarely brought into conversation with
developments in robotics. This article argues that we need a more
interdisciplinary approach. By drawing on insights from both social sciences
and social robotics, we explore how trust is shaped, tested and made visible.
Our goal is to open up a dialogue between disciplines and help build a more
grounded and adaptable framework for understanding trust in the evolving world
of human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Robotic information gathering (RIG) techniques refer to methods where mobile
robots are used to acquire data about the physical environment with a suite of
sensors. Informative planning is an important part of RIG where the goal is to
find sequences of actions or paths that maximize efficiency or the quality of
information collected. Many existing solutions solve this problem by assuming
that the environment is known in advance. However, real environments could be
unknown or time-varying, and adaptive informative planning remains an active
area of research. Adaptive planning and incremental online mapping are required
for mapping initially unknown or varying spatial fields. Gaussian process (GP)
regression is a widely used technique in RIG for mapping continuous spatial
fields. However, it falls short in many applications as its real-time
performance does not scale well to large datasets. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes an efficient adaptive informative planning approach for
mapping continuous scalar fields with GPs with streaming sparse GPs. Simulation
experiments are performed with a synthetic dataset and compared against
existing benchmarks. Finally, it is also verified with a real-world dataset to
further validate the efficacy of the proposed method. Results show that our
method achieves similar mapping accuracy to the baselines while reducing
computational complexity for longer missions.

Motivation: 尽管抓取是机器人的基本技能，但现有的学习方法仍难以在不同夹具和真实环境中泛化。

Method: 采用迭代扩散过程建模抓取生成，结合DiffusionTransformer架构和高效判别器训练方法。

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人实验中，GraspGen表现优于现有方法，并在FetchBench基准测试中达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: GraspGen通过创新的架构和训练方法，显著提升了抓取生成的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Grasping is a fundamental robot skill, yet despite significant research
advancements, learning-based 6-DOF grasping approaches are still not turnkey
and struggle to generalize across different embodiments and in-the-wild
settings. We build upon the recent success on modeling the object-centric grasp
generation process as an iterative diffusion process. Our proposed framework,
GraspGen, consists of a DiffusionTransformer architecture that enhances grasp
generation, paired with an efficient discriminator to score and filter sampled
grasps. We introduce a novel and performant on-generator training recipe for
the discriminator. To scale GraspGen to both objects and grippers, we release a
new simulated dataset consisting of over 53 million grasps. We demonstrate that
GraspGen outperforms prior methods in simulations with singulated objects
across different grippers, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
FetchBench grasping benchmark, and performs well on a real robot with noisy
visual observations.

*Suzie Kim,Hye-Bin Shin,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于非侵入式脑电图（EEG）信号（尤其是错误相关电位，ErrPs）的隐式反馈强化学习框架（RLIHF），以解决稀疏奖励条件下传统强化学习的不足。实验表明，该方法在复杂任务中表现接近手动设计的密集奖励方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在稀疏奖励条件下效果不佳，需要复杂的定制奖励函数。现有基于人类反馈的强化学习方法（RLHF）依赖显式反馈，增加了用户认知负担。本文希望通过隐式神经反馈（如EEG信号）提供更自然的反馈方式。

Method: 提出RLIHF框架，利用预训练的EEG解码器将原始EEG信号（尤其是ErrPs）转化为概率奖励信号，结合稀疏外部奖励进行策略学习。实验在MuJoCo模拟环境中进行，任务为带有障碍物的复杂抓取放置任务。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用EEG隐式反馈训练的智能体性能与使用密集手动奖励的智能体相当。这验证了隐式神经反馈在交互式机器人强化学习中的潜力。

Conclusion: RLIHF通过非侵入式EEG信号提供连续隐式反馈，为稀疏奖励条件下的强化学习提供了一种可扩展且与人类行为对齐的解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) ap proaches often struggle to learn
effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual
design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation,
rein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising
strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation
signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback
mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the
natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the
user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback
(RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)
signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous,
implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed
method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into
probabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in
the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a
simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2
robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding
obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents
trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those
trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the
potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned
reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管人类擅长工具操作，但教会机器人这些技能面临挑战，尤其是复杂接触关系的识别和仿真到现实的差距。

Method: 结合多模态感知（触觉和接近传感器），开发了一个少样本技能转移框架，先在仿真中预训练基础策略，再通过真实世界的少量示范进行微调。

Result: 实验证明，该框架能够在Franka Emika机器人上以少量示范成功教会工具表面跟随任务，且能识别工具与环境接触关系。

Conclusion: 多模态传感器结合和仿真到现实的技能转移策略有效提升了机器人工具使用的学习能力。

Abstract: Tools extend the manipulation abilities of robots, much like they do for
humans. Despite human expertise in tool manipulation, teaching robots these
skills faces challenges. The complexity arises from the interplay of two
simultaneous points of contact: one between the robot and the tool, and another
between the tool and the environment. Tactile and proximity sensors play a
crucial role in identifying these complex contacts. However, learning tool
manipulation using these sensors remains challenging due to limited real-world
data and the large sim-to-real gap. To address this, we propose a few-shot
tool-use skill transfer framework using multimodal sensing. The framework
involves pre-training the base policy to capture contact states common in
tool-use skills in simulation and fine-tuning it with human demonstrations
collected in the real-world target domain to bridge the domain gap. We validate
that this framework enables teaching surface-following tasks using tools with
diverse physical and geometric properties with a small number of demonstrations
on the Franka Emika robot arm. Our analysis suggests that the robot acquires
new tool-use skills by transferring the ability to recognise tool-environment
contact relationships from pre-trained to fine-tuned policies. Additionally,
combining proximity and tactile sensors enhances the identification of contact
states and environmental geometry.

Conclusion: 该方法为自主机器人执行复杂STL任务提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents a novel co-design strategy that integrates trajectory
planning and control to handle STL-based tasks in autonomous robots. The method
consists of two phases: $(i)$ learning spatio-temporal motion primitives to
encapsulate the inherent robot-specific constraints and $(ii)$ constructing an
STL-compliant motion plan from these primitives. Initially, we employ
reinforcement learning to construct a library of control policies that perform
trajectories described by the motion primitives. Then, we map motion primitives
to spatio-temporal characteristics. Subsequently, we present a sampling-based
STL-compliant motion planning strategy tailored to meet the STL specification.
The proposed model-free approach, which generates feasible STL-compliant motion
plans across various environments, is validated on differential-drive and
quadruped robots across various STL specifications. Demonstration videos are

Abstract: Robots are increasingly integrated across industries, particularly in
healthcare. However, many valuable applications for quadrupedal robots remain
overlooked. This research explores the effectiveness of three reinforcement
learning algorithms in training a simulated quadruped robot for autonomous
navigation and obstacle avoidance. The goal is to develop a robotic guide dog
simulation capable of path following and obstacle avoidance, with long-term
potential for real-world assistance to guide dogs and visually impaired
individuals. It also seeks to expand research into medical 'pets', including
robotic guide and alert dogs.
  A comparative analysis of thirteen related research papers shaped key
evaluation criteria, including collision detection, pathfinding algorithms,
sensor usage, robot type, and simulation platforms. The study focuses on sensor
inputs, collision frequency, reward signals, and learning progression to
determine which algorithm best supports robotic navigation in complex
environments.
  Custom-made environments were used to ensure fair evaluation of all three
algorithms under controlled conditions, allowing consistent data collection.
Results show that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) outperformed Deep
Q-Network (DQN) and Q-learning across all metrics, particularly in average and
median steps to goal per episode.
  By analysing these results, this study contributes to robotic navigation, AI
and medical robotics, offering insights into the feasibility of AI-driven
quadruped mobility and its role in assistive robotics.

Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies via imitation has proven effective across a wide
range of robotic domains. However, the performance of these policies is heavily
dependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive
data collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data
collection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging
existing or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as
public robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human
data from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic
flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model
(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of
robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent
Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by
searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real
world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of
policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement
with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50
demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand
episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different
robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.
